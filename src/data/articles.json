    "content": "It’s been nearly 200 years since the first Euro-Americans began settling would become McLean County. Those prairie pioneers of the 1820s, though, weren’t the first to raise corn around here. Not by a long shot. In fact, the county’s first known corn farmers date to circa AD 1200—an astounding 600-plus years before the era of white settlement. This story was uncovered—literally!—by archaeologists excavating the site of a Mississippian village north of present-day Heyworth. The site, known as Noble-Wieting, also includes the only known Native American mound in McLean County. Archaeological work conducted in the 1970s at Noble-Wieting (named for two families who once owned the property) offers incontrovertible proof of farming in McLean County nearly 300 years before Columbus reached the New World. Archaeologists recovered a shell hoe and shell corn scrapers, for instance, and located several deep pits used for storing corn and other foodstuff. Also recovered and later analyzed were carbonized bits of 800-year-old corn, beans and squash. Available evidence points to a Mississippian village of some ten houses and 40 to 60 residents, with a duration of occupancy that lasted less than a century, perhaps between 60 to 90 years. The mound, eroded by plowing, rains and the depredations of 19th century “pot hunters” or looters, appears today as little more than a barely noticeable rise in the surrounding landscape. The site is near Kickapoo Creek and several of its tributaries. The Bishop family began farming there in the early 1840s, and the pre-Columbian village and mound have remained under cultivation up to this day. From the 1880s to the late 1960s, the Noble family owned and farmed the property. A son-in-law, Wallace Wieting, purchased it in 1968. The rather remote site is no longer in the Wieting family, though it’s still privately held and not open to the public. The center of Mississippian culture was the great city of Cahokia, situated between present-day East St. Louis and Collinsville and across the Mississippi River from St. Louis. At its height the city’s population might have reached tens of thousands, as its trade links stretched to the Gulf Coast, Eastern Seaboard, Great Plains and Upper Midwest. Today, 80 of the city’s original 120 mounds are protected and within Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site. Most impressive is Monk’s Mound, which is 100 feet tall and covers 14 acres, making it the largest man-made earthen structure north of the great Mesoamerican civilizations of Mexico. The occupation of Noble-Wieting coincided with the decline in Cahokia’s influence and power. By AD 1300 the remaining residents had abandoned their once-great city; its collapse one of many Gordian Knot-like mysteries this pre-literate society left for archaeologists to untangle. From available evidence, the Mississippians inhabiting the Noble-Wieting site had a wide-ranging diet. They hunted, getting most of their animal protein from elk and deer; farmed corn, beans and squash; fished in streams and rivers; and gathered fruits, nuts and wild plants within or along the edges of the area’s wooded groves. One reason this Mississippian site is of interest to archaeologists is its location within the broad and fluid boundary between Middle and Upper Mississippian traditions. Evidence of this cultural intersection can be seen in the differences in pottery-making techniques and in the shape and design of bowls, jars and other items. On Oct. 17, 1900, a well-intentioned though decidedly amateur archeological excavation was undertaken under the auspices of the McLean County Historical Society (now the Museum of History). The party of some thirty society members and guests included J.H. Burnham, LaFayette Funk and J.B. Orendorff. That day, Burnham and Funk estimated that the mound reached two-and-a-half feet in height and encompassed an area 75 feet in diameter. Early settlers to the area maintained that the mound was originally anywhere from six to eight feet tall. In the upper reaches of the burial mound the excavating party encountered, as expected, a layer of scattered bones. These remains had been previously exhumed and reinterred by an undetermined number of curiosity seekers, including John Noble, the landowner at the time. About two feet below the disturbed layer the party then unearthed bones from seven or eight individuals (most of these were likewise reburied in the mound). There have been other Mississippian items recovered in scattered sites in McLean County, though nothing hinting at another settlement such as Noble-Wieting. The collections of the McLean County Museum of History include a Mississippian ceramic bowl said to have been recovered from a grave in Lawndale Township. This ceramic bowl is one of several Mississippian objects on display in the museum’s “Making a Home” exhibit. Other Mississippian objects on view include a pottery fragment of local clay tempered with crushed mussel shells, projectile points (once known as arrowheads) and the business end of a hoe made from chert. In 1966, Fred Brian, an Illinois Wesleyan University art professor, and William Haney from Illinois State University, organized a one-week “dig” at the site. Brian returned in 1968 and 1970, and during the latter excavation he uncovered six burials, with the skulls taken to IWU for analysis and the remains reinterred. The Noble-Wieting burials show no evidence of socioeconomic stratification, a marked departure from the traditions of Cahokia where ruling figures were sometimes buried with a trove of worldly goods and other status markers. ISU professor Dr. Edward Jelks led a four-week field school in 1972. Discoveries that summer included the location of a house, as well as numerous trash pits containing shards of pottery and broken pieces of stone and bone tools. There were also blackened bits of vegetable matter, evidence of meals cooked some 800 years earlier. Chemical flotation tests would later show these tiny pieces to be leftovers of beans, squash, black walnuts, wild grape and pawpaw. And there were 140 fragments of corn—the earliest corn ever found in McLean County! There were two varieties, one with eight-rows of kernels and the other with twelve, though both produced ears not much longer than an inch-and-a-half. A second field school was held at the site in 1976, and a shortened one followed sixteen years later, in 1992. ISU’s Department of Sociology and Anthropology, in collaboration with the Illinois State Archaeological Survey, is holding a four-week field school at the Noble-Wieting site this year, beginning May 22. This latest field school, led by Dr. Logan Miller and to include 14 undergraduates and upwards of 5 graduate students, will continue to probe the secrets of this 800-year-old Native American village. In doing so these young archaeologists-in-training will be asking several interrelated questions fundamental to their discipline: Who were these people? What did they believe? How did they reshape the natural world around them? And in answering these and other questions, one final one, common to all great disciplines, looms the largest: Who then are we?",

    "content": "Tucked away on Bloomington’s far west side, Buck Mann Park is one of the lovelier, out-of-the-way corners in all the Twin Cities. Located on Weldon Street in Stevensonville, a historic working-class neighborhood, the park’s namesake is William “Buck” Mann, a coal miner, railroad brakeman and later alderman who in the late 1920s led the charge to open a playground in this long-underserved part of the city. As a voice for the west side, he earned a reputation “for his impulsive advocation of measures for the common people and his love of children.” Born in Bloomington in 1878, Mann grew up on the west side in a working-class family. As a boy, he got his first job as a caller for the Chicago and Alton (C&A) Railroad Shops. “Before the days of telephones, a call boy’s job was to roust train crews and let them know when their next run would be,” explains local historian and community leader Mike Matejka. “This included rapping on bedroom windows in the middle of the night, or tracking down trainmen at restaurants, poker games or taverns.” While still a teenager, Mann began working in the local mines, mostly with the McLean County Coal Co., located off West Washington Street just west of the C&A tracks (now Union Pacific and Amtrak). After seven years in the mines and sustaining a broken hip, among other related workplace injuries, he put in another seven with the C&A as a brakeman. In the steam-powered Industrial Age there were few jobs as dangerous as coal miner, though railroad brakeman was surely one of them. In 1914, Mann was seriously injured in Lawndale, Logan County, when he lost his balance stepping off a lurching railcar and was thrown between the tracks. “Since that time,” related The Pantagraph years later, “he had sought relief by many treatments and operations for severe pain in the head.” He eventually tired of life as an industrial wage earner, leaving that world behind for the relative peace and quiet of one as a neighborhood grocer. His residence and grocery store were located on the 1400 block of West Oakland Avenue, a stone’s throw away from both where he grew up and the future park he would help build. In 1926, after running and losing three times for alderman, Mann finally won a seat on the city council. He was reelected to a second term in 1928 (today, Ward 6, minus downtown, mirrors much of Mann’s old Ward 7.) “When he first was elected he demanded that the Seventh Ward be given equal consideration with all other wards in improvements and representations,” noted The Pantagraph. Into the 1920s, there were no paved city streets west of the C&A tracks, though by the end of the decade, a stretch of West Olive Street had been paved, and a few side streets graveled. Much of Stevensonville, and all of the Sunnyside addition, were not connected to city sewers until the late 1920s or early 1930s. Prior to that, the area relied on the Bloomington’s last open sewer, which ran straight into Sugar Creek. Furthermore, the children of Stevensonville and the surrounding residential area, including Sunnyside, had no park or playground to call their own. In the spring of 1928, Mann helped organize the Seventh Ward Playground Association, which led the charge to transform a privately owned, 90 by 240 foot vacant lot on Weldon Street into a neighborhood park. The association, working with the landowners George Baum and Allie Peterson, agreed to pay the property taxes until enough money had been raised to purchase the grounds outright. The lot, an uneven, junk-strewn thicket of weeds and box elder saplings three to 15 feet tall, looked like anything but a safe and welcoming space for children. That began to change the evening of Thursday, Jun. 21, 1928, when Mann, armed with a meat clever from is grocery store, began attacking the “wilderness of bramble bushes.” The alderman was soon joined by a large group of volunteers, including Weldon Street residents James Daley, a railroad switchman; Frank Erdman, a laborer; Louis Gottschalk, who shoveled coal for Illinois Power and Light Co.; Arthur Johnson, a machine operator with Meadows Manufacturing; and others. “Men who had worked all day at many trades turned out en masse to make a playground,” reported The Pantagraph several days later. “They returned Friday night. They returned Saturday night. Sunday, the plat was cleared, the ground was partly leveled. The weeds were gone and the beginning of the ‘Seventh Ward Playground’ was well underway.” Merle Butler, who lived on the 1300 block of West Jackson Street, donated a scraper, plow, harrow and disc, and a team of work horses. Clarence Dalton hauled away more than 40 loads of rubbish in his garbage wagon. Funds were raised by knocking on doors and soliciting pledges. “It was not an easy task to raise that sum among residents of the vicinity, who were mostly wage earners,” remarked The Pantagraph. There were also several fundraisers, including a community carnival, a supper, which drew 370 people, and two dances, though only the second one made money. Some playground equipment was made by local residents in their workshops or garages, and soon enough the park featured “a six-rack swing, horseshoe courts, baseball diamond, merry-go-round and other devices.” The city donated lights and agreed to pipe in water. Sadly, Mann did not live to see his vision come to full fruition. He passed away on Jul. 24, 1929, at the age of 51. “His illness was of long-standing,” recalled The Pantagraph, referring to his injuries sustained as a coal miner and railroad brakeman. Five days after Mann’s death, members of the playground association gathered under the park’s lights and decided to rename the grounds for “Buck” Mann. It was also agreed to construct a memorial fountain in his honor (see accompanying photograph), and to fly the park’s flag at half mast every Jul. 24 to mark his passing. At the time of Mann’s death, the association was nearing its fundraising goal, and shortly thereafter the sale of the playground lot was finalized and the deeds transferred. In November 1929, the neighborhood group reported $3,205 in receipts and $2,369.95 in expenditures, with most of the latter going to the lot’s purchase. Eight years later, in the summer of 1937, the Buck Mann Playground Association offered its grounds to the city, and today, the handsome municipal park features a basketball court, playground equipment and a ball field. Due to its out-of-the-way location and the regrettable west side bias harbored by too many Twin City residents, Buck Mann Park remains one of the community’s hidden gems. “Our changing the [park’s] name is the least we can do for Buck,” Harry Ekstam, president of the playground association, said back in the summer of 1929. “Possibly the idea of Seventh Ward has been emphasized too much. All children are welcome here. This is not limited to one ward. Buck always said that. By giving the grounds his name we will be keeping alive his ideal to have a place for all.”",

    "content": "Today the median age of Korean War veterans is 88 years old, and as the ranks of these old soldiers get increasingly thinner there will soon come a day when they will all be gone. During the Great Depression, Americans faced a similar inexorable loss and poignant farewell. In March 1936, the closing of Bloomington-Normal’s last Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) post signaled the coming end of the Civil War generation. The GAR was a fraternal organization of Union veterans that wielded impressive political power in the decades after the war. In 1890, the GAR boasted a national membership of 490,000—nearly half a million veterans. The Bloomington post carried the name of William T. Sherman, the Union commander known for the March to the Sea and the axiom, “War is hell.” Ninety-five-year-old Bloomington resident Joseph W. Fifer, the local GAR post commander and former Illinois governor, was the only veteran able to attend the rather bittersweet ceremony closing the local post. The three other remaining Bloomington-Normal veterans couldn’t come, given their frail health and limited mobility. Attending were representative of the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War (SUVCW) and the corresponding daughters’ organization. Two months later, The Pantagraph ran photographs of the four living Civil War veterans in Bloomington-Normal: Fifer, Benajah Brigham, Charles Mayo and Aaron Will. All had been members of the William T. Sherman GAR post. Less than a year after the post closed its doors for good, Aaron Will became the first of the final four veterans to leave this “ vale of tears” behind. He died February 28, 1937, at the home of his daughter, Grace Protzman, 809 S. Allin St. A 92-year-old Will had served in the 133rd Pennsylvania Regiment and saw action at Fredericksburg and elsewhere. He came to Bloomington after the war and worked in the dry goods business for more than 60 years. A 96-year-old Charles Mayo, who served three years in the 79th Illinois Infantry Regiment, died at his home at 601 S. Linden St. (the vacant lot at the southwest corner of Linden and Vernon streets) on February 2, 1938. Joseph Fifer and Benajah Brigham, believed to be the last two living Civil War veterans in Bloomington, served together in Company C of the 33rd Illinois Infantry Regiment. During the spring and summer of 1863, Fifer and Brigham were part of Ulysses S. Grant’s epic campaign to take Vicksburg, Miss., the last Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi River. “And so it went in those early days of May—fast marches and a great deal of the ugliest kind of fighting,” Fifer recalled. “It was no place for the laggards or the give-outs.” Most of Fifer’s war recollections are matter-of-fact. For instance: “I shall never forget the cannonade in mid-May when a shell cut off the head of the captain of our company—Captain [Henry M.] Kellogg, who had come into the war from the superintendency of a seminary for girls.” Yet even his more picturesque descriptions of that campaign ring true. “It was mid-May now, and the magnolia trees were in bloom, and the roses and lilies and myrtles,” he said. “So much beauty—and so much blood and pain, and the weary marches. It was hard to understand why so fair a world should not produce a race that could get on with itself.” On May 22, the 33rd’s Company C participated in an assault on the formidable Confederate works at Vicksburg. A small force following the lead of 8th Indiana’s Col. David Shunk made it as far as the Rebel’s first line of defensive works. Three Company C soldiers were killed in the assault while several wounded, including Brigham. In the fighting that month, 33rd casualties totaled 19 killed and 102 wounded, 10 if whom would die “in hospital.” Grant starved out Vicksburg and the fortress-like city fell on July 4, 1863. There was little time for celebration though as Confederate Gen. Joseph E. Johnston began menacing Grant from the east. In a July 13 engagement near the burned-out Mississippi state capital of Jackson, Fifer was shot through the lung and liver. Though nearly given up for dead, he survived and was back with Company C the following spring. Fifer mustered out in October 1864 while his brother George, also in the 33rd, remained behind only to die of wounds from a clash at Fort Esperanza, Tex. Fifer settled in Bloomington where he studied law at Illinois Wesleyan University. In 1888, the former enlisted man ran for governor, earning the nickname “Private Joe” because he defeated six former Union Army officers—three generals, one colonel, one major, and one captain!—for the Republican nomination. He passed away on August 6, 1938, at the age of 97. During the war, Benajah Brigham, Fifer’s comrade-in-arms, “re-upped” at the end of his three-year enlistment and then remained with the 33rd through the war’s conclusion, attaining the rank of sergeant. When the war was over, he farmed in Blue Mound Township in east-central McLean County, and in 1868 married Elizabeth Sherer. They then moved to Bloomington in 1896 and he kept busy in real estate and insurance dealings. Their children included William B. Brigham, a superintendent of McLean County schools, local historian and amateur archaeologist. In Brigham’s final years, The Pantagraph would pay an annual call to old soldier’s residence, 706 E. Bell St., on the occasion of his November 3 birthday. The usual order of the day included a family dinner around noon and visits from friends and well wishers. For his 97th birthday in 1937, he predicted a coming war in Europe and his belief that France would once more take it on the chin. In early November 1939, the still-alert Brigham was described as being in good health. “Still actively studying the newspapers, this man who has lived almost a century keeps up on world affairs,” noted The Pantagraph. The end for Brigham came on August 5, 1940, almost exactly two years after Fifer’s death. Brigham was laid to rest with full military honors at what is now Evergreen Memorial Cemetery in Bloomington. “This is a sad occasion for all of us,” said a Legionnaire and World War I veteran after Brigham’s funeral. “It’s a grim reminder that soon we’ll be fading away like those veterans who were numerous only a short time ago.” It’s believed that Brigham was the last Civil War veteran in the Twin Cities, but not in McLean County. There was, for instance, John F. Eddings, who passed away in his hometown of Arrowsmith on May 8, 1941. The 98-year-old Eddings had served in the 40th Illinois Infantry Regiment, though whether he was the last living “Boy in Blue” in the county is not known. Nationally, the last confirmed living Civil War veteran was Albert Henry Woolson, who was around 15 years old in 1865 when he enlisted in a Minnesota artillery regiment as a company drummer. He died on August 2, 1956, at the likely age of 106.",

    "content": "This week marks the 100th anniversary of the horrific Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus train wreck, one of the deadliest in U.S. history. On June 22, 1918, outside of Hammond, Ind., a Michigan Central Railroad locomotive pulling empty Pullman passenger cars barreled into the back end of an idling circus train, killing more than 80 performers, trainers, roustabouts, and other “comrades of the big top.” The dead included Jennie Ward of the Flying Wards, one of the more successful aerialist troupes to emerge from the circus hotbed of Bloomington. Bessie Katrenke, a newcomer to the Wards, also perished in the collision. Survivors from the troupe included Jennie’s husband, Alec Todd, her brother Eddie Ward, and Eddie’s wife Marian. By the early 20th century, Bloomington had earned a national reputation as a training ground for aerialist, with well-known acts including the La Vans, Concellos, Fishers, LeMars and Valentinos / Valentines. Bloomington, in fact, was once dubbed the “Trapeze Capital of the World.” The Wards, unlike some of the aerialist troupes with local connections, were Bloomington born and raised. The Ward barn on Emerson Street (later the site of the Grand Hotel restaurant) was built in 1915 expressly to train aerialists and acrobats. In the late spring and summer of 1918, the Wards were “flying” for Hagenbeck-Wallace, one of the larger and more popular circuses of its day. In the early morning hours of June 22, 1918, a Central Michigan engineer operating an unoccupied passenger train had fallen asleep in his cab, and in doing so failed to heed the warnings from at least one automatic signal and a circus train flagman. The Central Michigan locomotive and its steel-frame Pullman passenger cars barreled into and circus train, crumpling or “telescoping” four older, flimsier wooden coaches. The circus train cars were lit with oil or gas lamps, which quickly turned the wreckage into a fiery charnel house. The final death toll is usually listed at 86 souls, though accounts vary. Some 200 others were injured. The Chicago press hailed Eddie Ward of Bloomington as a hero. He was thrown clear of wreck, and once he regained his bearings, he pulled his wife Mayme and then sister Jennie Ward from the burning debris. Mayme survived, but Jennie was likely already dead. According to one account, her back had been broken in the collision, meaning her death was likely instantaneous. Meanwhile, Eddie returned to the mangled wreckage. “Choked and blinded with the fumes of burning wood and human flesh he worked like a demon at the scene of the holocaust,” recounted the Chicago News in the rather lurid prose common for the time. One of those saved by Ward was Lon Moore, a veteran clown. “My arms were pinioned to my sides and something lay across my throat and something else across my head. I guess I was about gone,” recounted the showman. “I looked up through a little hole in the roof and there was someone clawing at it with his bare hands to make it bigger.” It was Eddie Ward. At one point, Ward is said to have suffered burns attempting to rescue four women. “I saw the flames creep on them and heard their maddening cries,” recounted the Bloomington aerialist the day after the wreck from St. Margaret’s Hospital in Hammond. “They ring in my ears in this quiet hospital ward. They will always ring in my ears.” Eugene and Mary Enos, two aerialist acrobats from Bloomington not associated with the Flying Wards, were also trapped in the wreckage. Eddie Ward pulled Mary from the wreck, and Mary in turn pulled her husband Gene to safety. “There was no water to be had—the wounded lay around naked and shrieking for help and water,” added Ward. “The screams from the burning coaches soon ceased, however.” In the days after the wreck circus folk, friends and relatives grappled with the nearly unbearable task of identifying the corpses, most “charred and mangled beyond recognition.” Less than one week later, the majority of the dead, many of whom remained unidentified, were interred in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Chicago suburb of Forest Park. Their final resting place was a large section purchased by the Showman’s League of America, an association of carnival performers. Today, the “Showmen’s Rest” plot is ringed by five elephant statues, their trunks lowered in a touching pachydermal gesture of mourning. Jennie Ward’s earthly remains arrived back in Bloomington on June 25, aboard a Chicago & Alton Railroad train. The Ward’s East Emerson Street home and practice barn, “which ordinarily was the scene of pleasure and where happiness reigned, is enshrouded with gloom” observed The Pantagraph. Alec Todd said he had no memories of the accident. “He is grief stricken over the death of his wife and burst into tears when he spoke of her,” noted a reporter. Ward’s funeral service was held at First Christian Church, Bloomington, and included the choir singing “Beautiful Isle of Somewhere.” She was laid to rest June 26 at Park Hill Cemetery on Bloomington’s west side. Yet despite the enormous pain and suffering, a “show must go on” ethos reigned among circus performers—physical and psychological trauma be damned. “The surviving members of the Flying Wards,” reported the July 3 Pantagraph, “are expecting to patch up the act as much as is possible and continue the season’s work.” Accordingly, the remaining aerialists, including Eddie and Mayme Ward and Alec Todd, left Bloomington on July 8 to rejoin the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus somewhere in South Dakota or Minnesota, a short two weeks and two days after the wreck. Clearly, the traumatized performers had insufficient time to heal. “The members are as yet badly ‘crippled up’ and have not recovered from the injuries nor from the nervous shock,” noted a sympathetic Pantagraph a few days before the troupe’s departure. Milner Library, Illinois State University, houses the world-class Circus and Allied Arts Collection. That treasure trove of material includes books, films, scrapbooks, a Ringling archive, photographs, correspondence and artifacts like posters and even the fly-bar from the Ward Barn on Emerson Street. These things, along with the rich history of ISU’s Gamma Phil Circus, speak to the invaluable role the Twin Cities play in keeping circus traditions alive. In April, Normal and ISU hosted the Circus Fans Association of America’s annual convention. Maureen Brunsdale, head of Special Collections at Milner, reported that during the convention a descendant of Eddie Ward presented a postcard by Jennie written shortly before the wreck revealing that she was expecting a child at the time of her death.",

    "content": "With Major League Baseball’s spring training well underway in the warmer, sunnier climes of Florida and Arizona, thoughts of this writer naturally turn to Bloomington-Normal’s many and deep connections to the National Pastime. When it comes to baseball, the Twin City’s favorite son has long been larger-than-life Charles “Old Hoss” Radbourn, the ill-tempered, right-handed pitcher who won an astounding 59 games for Providence, R.I. in 1884, which to this day remains the single-season big league record. Yet even some local diehards of the game and its history don’t know that there was another Bloomingtonian on the Grays roster during Radbourn’s immortal season. Indeed, Cliff Carroll, Providence’s standout leftfielder, learned to play game on the sandlots of Bloomington after the Civil War, this at a time when “base ball” (as it was often spelled back then) captured the nation’s imagination as it evolved into something recognizably close to the modern game. This Bloomington-raised, right-handed, switch-hitting speedster enjoyed a productive eleven-year Major League career, becoming one of the best outfielders and base runners of the era. Yet Carroll walked away from big league fame and (relative) fortune to become a McLean County corn farmer. Yes, it’s true! Born in Clay Grove, Ia., in 1859, Samuel Clifford Carroll spent the bulk of his formative years in the Twin Cities, only leaving Central Illinois in his late teens to play professional minor league ball. Nineteenth century baseball and its rough-and-tumble, urban, working class milieu were characterized by toxic masculinity, profanity, hard-drinking, brawling, womanizing and gambling. Carroll’s roots, on the other hand, were more middle class and genteel in nature. His parents, John and L. Marie Gustin Carroll, came to Bloomington in 1867 with son Cliff in tow, and for years the family ran a grocery store on the north end of downtown. Their well-kept home was on the 400 block of East Chestnut Street, just east of Franklin Park. Cliff Carroll’s career as a paid athlete likely dates to 1877 when as a 17-year-old he played for one of Bloomington’s early semi-pro teams. The Bloomington “nine” (as clubs were often called) included Charlie Radbourn, Carroll’s future Providence teammate and National Baseball Hall of Fame inductee. Astoundingly, when Carroll came into the National League as a Providence rookie in 1882, all but the catcher played the field barehanded. The slow transition to gloves wasn’t completed until the mid-1890s (and the glove’s distinctive web between the first finger and thumb wasn’t developed until the 1920s.) Suffice to say, jammed, sprained and broken fingers were common, and amputations of shattered or infected digits were not unknown. Indeed, Carroll’s permanently misshapen fingers and swollen hands were shown in a 1911 newspaper with the caption, “Famous National Leaguer carries proof of long career on diamond.” During the 1884 season, Carroll batted .261 (the league average was .247) as the leftfielder for the pennant-winning Grays. Of course, this season is best known today for Old Hoss Radbourn’s herculean feat of winning 59 games as a starting pitcher. It’s inconceivable that anyone will ever break—let alone come close to threatening—this 135-year-old record. After all, no one has reached even 30 victories in a single season since Denny McLain of the Detroit Tigers went 31-6 in 1968—and that was 51 years ago! Let it be noted that Carroll made baseball history that season as well. It’s said that during an Aug. 9 home game against archrival Boston, he led off the bottom of eighth inning with what some writers contend was the first known (or at least first recorded) bunt in baseball history. According to one report, the 6,000 or so fans in attendance “roared with laughter” as Carroll tapped the ball before the befuddled Boston infielders and streaked safely to first base. In the manly world of 19th century baseball, a bunt was almost an affront to spirit of the game. “A vigorous striking out,” lectured one reporter, “is preferable to a baby blow to the bat.” Nonetheless, all these many years later, the bunt remains an important part of the game. After four years with the Providence Grays, Carroll played two seasons with the Washington, D.C. Nationals (they were also called the Senators or Statesmen). Then, in 1888, he appeared in 5 games for the Pittsburgh Alleghenys before hanging up his spikes and leaving the grit and glamour of professional baseball for the quieter and more solitary life as a Corn Belt farmer. By all accounts, Carroll worked his Randolph Township farm in southern McLean County in apparent peace and anonymity. Yet in early 1890, he was called out of retirement by the legendary Adrian “Cap” Anson, skipper of the National League Chicago Colts (this was before the Colts became known as the Cubs!) “For two years Carroll has been farming south of the city, but has come to the conclusion that there is more money in base ball,” noted The Pantagraph. “Farmer” Carroll (as he was sometimes nicknamed) appeared in 236 games over two seasons with the Colts, batting a career high .285 in his first year in the Windy City. In fact, he achieved personal bests in several offensive and defensive categories during the 1890 season. He then finished his big league career with St. Louis (1892) and Boston (1893). During his eleventh and final season, Carroll was an everyday outfielder as the 86-43 Beaneaters captured the 12-team National League pennant. The 34 year old Carroll then walked away from the game once more, though “this time for all time.” Again, he turned to farming, settling in east central Illinois, near the Vermilion County community of Hoopeston. A move to Portland, Ore. followed sometime around 1910, and it was there that Samuel Clifford Carroll passed away on Jun. 12, 1923. His death was noted across the country. “Carroll,” remarked The Rock Island Argus newspaper, “was one of the favorite heroes of the olden days as [Babe] Ruth is at the present.” “Carroll was the proud possessor of a great collection of trophies won on the ball field and innumerable souvenirs gathered during his 17 years on the diamond,” remembered Pittsburgh sportswriter Ed F. Ballinger (who must’ve included some minor league seasons when totaling up Carroll’s career.) “One of his favorite keepsakes which now is highly prized by his family, is a winged foot of solid gold inlaid with many diamonds. It was gift of admiring fans and it symbolized the fleetness for which he was famed in his time.” Yet once out of the game, Carroll didn’t seem to miss the adulation. “One of the greatest baseball players of the game died in Portland recently,” observed The Oregonian, a Portland newspaper, “but so modest was he that few even knew he had been spending his last years here.”",

    "content": "Although it may be hard to believe, the current Bloomington High School is nearly six decades old. The school opened back in the fall of 1959, a mid-century modernist beauty symbolizing the jet age optimism and promise of postwar America. Yet as the “new” Bloomington High’s price tag topped $3.66 million (the equivalent of nearly $31 million in inflation-adjusted 2018 dollars), the district found itself—smack in the middle of construction no less—scrambling to raise additional funds in order to complete and open the school. The previous high school, located on the 500 block of East Washington Street, opened in 1917. The two schools—old and new Bloomington High—represented a revolutionary shift in American education as administrators sought to escape the confines of the urban grid and congested older neighborhoods for open spaces and suburban-like settings more suitable to the sprawling footprints of modern school “campuses.” Accordingly, in March 1948, the Board of Education purchased a 39.7 acre site known as the Grassfield tract with the expectation that it would become the future home to a new high school. Situated between Empire Street on the north, Towanda Avenue on the east, Locust Street on the south and Colton Avenue on the west, this site made perfect sense. The sloping, undeveloped acreage provided ample space for classroom expansion, additional athletic fields, and, this being the golden age of the American teenager’s love affair with the automobile, parking. In addition, the school’s football field was already located immediately south across Locust Street, where it had been for some two decades. By the mid-1950s, with the postwar baby boom well underway, Bloomington’s schools were bursting at the seams. On Sept. 20, 1955, district voters approved a $2.9 million bond issue to pay for both new schools and new additions to existing schools. For many Bloomington residents, consolidating the junior high classes (then scattered at Bent, Irving, and Washington schools) into the old East Washington Street building was as eagerly anticipated as the construction of the new high school. Two prominent Bloomington architectural firms, Lundeen and Hilfinger, and Schaeffer, Wilson and Evans, were involved in the development of new Bloomington High. In addition, A. Richard Williams, University of Illinois professor of architecture, served as the project’s lead designer. Williams, who grew up in the Twin Cities (his father was an accounting professor at Illinois State Normal University), was a visionary modernist. He played a leading role in several of the finer postwar buildings in the area, including Bloomington Federal Savings and Loan Association (opened in 1957, and now part of the Government Center). School officials rightly boasted that the architects took “full advantage of the natural beauty of the site.” The original two-story classroom building faces Locust Street from the highest point on the rolling tract. An attractive 12½ foot overhang runs the length of this building. To its northeast a one-story wing contained the cafeteria, music and band rooms, shop classes and a garage. When it opened in 1959, Bloomington High School was an exemplar of International style architecture. Many of its design elements, such as the flat roof, large expanse of windows, metal casements, slender columns and an absence of architectural embellishments, are hallmarks of mid-century modernism. Perhaps the school’s most striking feature remains the gymnasium’s “scalloped” cantilevered trusses extending from the east and west walls. For its part, The Pantagraph called the planned high school the “Lyceum of Bloomington students to come—not a palace but certainly no livery stable.” “Cautious optimism” marked the high school’s groundbreaking ceremony of Aug 20, 1957. The cautiousness came from community leaders well aware that there were insufficient funds to complete construction. The district had around $2.67 million available for a school projected to cost an additional $500,000 or more. Part of the problem involved the inherent difficulties districts faced confronting ever-larger baby boom enrollments. At the same time, inflation, especially when it came to construction costs, took an increasingly bigger bite out of capital budgets. But more than anything, the district’s shortfall was due to an Illinois Department of Revenue decision to fix the tax multiplier at a point that increased county assessed valuations at a lower-than-expected rate, meaning that in the latter half of the 1950s, Bloomington schools had fewer dollars than anticipated coming into district coffers. “It’s not going to be easy to provide adequate schools,” State Sen. David Davis IV told those gathered at the groundbreaking, “and it’s going to squeeze my pocketbook and your pocketbook.” Given these fiscal realities, school officials felt they had little choice but to call a second bond referendum, with this one asking voters for another $590,000, or enough to complete the high school. Architect Edgar Lundeen defended the school in the face of accusations among disgruntled taxpayers that the new building was too expensive and extravagant. For instance, Lundeen noted that the gymnasium’s cantilevered trusses, contrary to grumbling among some penny-pinching residents, did not add additional costs to the project. And in other instances of presumed profligacy, the architects were simply following instructions guided by public input and set by school officials, such as building a state-of-the-art auditorium separate from the gymnasium. Fortunately, the October 1958 referendum passed with relative ease—4,576 to 2,460. Not surprisingly, the bond issue proved most popular on the high-growth east side where support ran 3 to 1 or higher. With sufficient funds to complete construction, Bloomington High School welcomed its first students on Sept. 9, 1959. In 1967, district voters approved a $5.3 million bond referendum, with about $3.1 million of that set aside to double the size of the existing high school. New additions included the south gymnasium and an area vocational center. Over the years, Bloomington High School has undergone further remodeling projects and expansions. Most recently, with a planned fine arts addition, local architect Russel Francois has ensured that his design work remains mindful of Richard Williams’ original architectural vision. Unfortunately, not all past work has served the school well, architecturally speaking. For instance, the south gymnasium, which opened in 1970, is a utilitarian, boxy brick rectangle that stands as a conspicuous mismatch to Williams’ airy modernism. The south gymnasium also obstructs the view of the original gym and part of the original classroom wing. A drive down Locust Street once offered the impressive vista of a sleek and shiny school of the future perched on a rise and surrounded by open expanse. The school’s mid-century modern sparkle is still there, it’s just harder to see and appreciate.",

    "content": "“The members of the Lotus Club last evening entertained their lady friends at their rooms on North Center Street,” noted The Pantagraph of April 21, 1894. “They tripped merrily through the evening to the melodious strains of Orpheus Mandolin Orchestra.” Two musicians with local connections—Fred T. Ashton and Lloyd Allayre Loar—speak to the popularity of the mandolin in the final decades of the 19th century and into the first decades of the 20th century. The Classical Mandolin Society of America is holding its convention at the Marriott Hotel in Uptown Normal Oct. 9-13. This convention will feature mandolin players from across the U.S. and Canada, Europe and Japan. Also performing will be the Twin Cities based Orpheus Mandolin Orchestra. Although this 12-member group dates to 2003, its name comes from Fred Ashton’s late-19th century orchestra. Mandolin enthusiasts today speak of a “golden age” that dated to the Paris Exposition of 1879. It was there that the mandolin became all the rage in Europe after performances by Estudiantes Espanoles (Spanish Students) at the Paris Exposition of 1878. The instrument’s popularity spread to the U.S. “Thousands were taking up the instrument as a pastime, and it became an instrument of society, taken up by young men and women,” it’s been noted. “Mandolin orchestras were formed worldwide, incorporating not only the mandolin family of instruments, but also guitars, double basses zithers.” As early as 1882, an eleven-year-old Ashton’s performance on violin drew notice in the local press. The Orpheus Mandolin Orchestra organized in the early 1890s, with Ashton as its director. “The Orpheus Mandolin Club has been out serenading several nights lately,” reported the Sept. 23, 1891 Pantagraph. “All are experts on this sweet instrument and the music is charming and greatly delights all who hear it.” In addition to Ashton, the club’s director, the performers at this time included Will Homuth, watchmaker; Eugene McColm, a bookbinder with Pantagraph Printing and Stationery Co.; William E. McLernon, a printer who was also at Pantagraph Printing and Stationery; Carol Sprague, a jeweler (who worked with Homuth); and Fred Thomas, Pantagraph Printing and Stationery printer. One month later, the group delivered matinee and evening Thanksgiving performances at the Grand Opera House on the 100 block of East Market Street. This theater building burned down in 1907, replaced by the Chatterton (later renamed the Illini) which still stands adjacent to Lucca Grill. The orchestra, “assisted by the best vocal and instrumental talent in the city, under the direction of Fred T. Ashton, will give the people of Bloomington one of the best concerts ever heard in this city,” was the promise. Tickets ranged fro 25 to 50 cents. “Instructor of violin, mandolin and guitar, banjo and all orchestral and band instruments,” Ashton advertised in 1893. “Manager and director of the Orpheus Mandolin Orchestra.” At the time, his studio was located in the Grand Opera House. Later, Ashton and his wife Alberta Rickey established a music studio on North Main Street where they taught mostly piano and violin. Ashton then became the director of the Bloomington Band, formed from a merger of two local organizations—the DeMolay Band, sponsored by the Knight Templar, and the Dillon Band, directed by Ora Dillon. “Open to all high class engagements, tea parties, receptions private dancing parties and clubs,” read a promotional item for the 1895-96 season. “Special inducements to all out of town engagements, commencements, dinner parties, weddings, etc.” In addition to Ashton, the orchestra then included Frank Miller, Henry Muhl and Fred Thomas on mandolin; William Hull, cello; Fred Schroeder, flute; and William Thompson, harp. Ashton also composed and published his own works, including “Gay Tally Ho” and “The Caddy.” Ashton left Bloomington around 1920, eventually establishing a second career in Oklahoma as a director of music for Oklahoma City schools. Despite Ashton’s departure, the Bloomington Band, under the direction of George W. Marton, continued to be a major player in the local music and cultural scene. Ashton passed away in 1940. “There was a time,” eulogized The Pantagraph, “when a great social affair in this city could not be considered complete without Mr. Ashton and his orchestra.” The current Orpheus Mandolin Orchestra performs a range of popular music from the 1890s into the 1920s, including everything from marches to ragtime. “Loar, the ‘Wizard of the Mandolin,’ is a revelation to those who believe that instrument to occupy a secondary position in musical excellence,” noted a newspaper from Rushville, Ind. As a soprano, Shipp was said to have “a voice of great beauty, with a range of three octaves.” “This is a company of originality and variety,” noted a circular on the Fisher Shipp-led group of touring musicians. “The program will include violin, mandolin, viola, soprano and contralto solos, duets, instrumental trios, mixed trios … readings and song cycles in costume, character and musical studies and sketches.” The Bloomington Chautauqua of 1914 included performances by the Fisher-Shipp Concert Company. The Aug. 28 afternoon performances included two solos by contralto Pauline Harrison, “Happy Days” and “Irish Love Song;” an instrumental arrangement by Loar from William Tell; a solo by violinist Carolyn Pomroy; a “burlesque on grand opera” by Harrison and Shipp; and an closing ensemble number from “Il Trovatore.” In early July 1922, Loar and Shipp performed in Bloomington as the Gibsonian Orchestra. A Jul. 7 afternoon program included Loar on the saw and violin, and Shipp giving an impersonation and singing “The Daffodils” and “Annie Laurie.” The “Gibsonian plectral ensemble” performed at the Gibson City Chautauqua. One week later, on Aug 25, the Gibsonian Orchestra with Loar as director and Shipp and soprano and reader, performed in Mattoon, Ill. “Mr. Loar was generous with his saw numbers and also gave several viola selections, playing ‘The Rosary’ in the afternoon and again by request in the evening,” noted the local press. Shipp, assisted by Walter Kaye Bauer. “have two excellent comedy sketches, one, a takeoff on the movies, a humorous skit in pantomime, furnishing fun for afternoon and the other, in the evening, giving an equally ludicrous imitation of grand opera.” Loar was also a pioneer in the amplification of instruments, giving built an electric double bass in the mid-1920s. The Classical Mandolin Society of America convention in Normal the second weekend in October will include a number of concerts, including on Saturday night at the Center for Performing Arts on the Illinois State University campus. Admission to all concerts is free, though there attendees are encouraged to make a ten-dollar donation. Although its popularity has never reached the heights of more than a century ago, the mandolin has been incorporated into a wide range of musical, including bluegrass, Celtic, classical and even rock-n-roll.",

    "content": "Born and raised on Bloomington’s west side, Patrick Henry Morrissey became a national labor leader in his early thirties. As grand master (or president) of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen from 1895 to 1909, Morrissey was known as a friend to the rank and file, and a frequent visitor to the White House. Born Sept. 11, 1862, to Mary and John Morrissey, “Pat” grew up on the 800 block of West Monroe Street. Dominating the west side at this time was the Chicago & Alton (C&A) Railroad, the heavily trafficked freight and passenger line connecting Chicago to St. Louis and used today by Union Pacific and Amtrak. The C&A depot was on the west side, as were the railroad’s sprawling shops and yards where locomotives and railcars were maintained, repaired and refurbished. The working-class Morrissey family prized education, and the children attended school long after most of their west side peers had entered the labor force. That’s not to say a young Patrick Morrissey didn’t work during his school years. Education of a different sort occurred in and around the C&A Shops where he found employment as a call boy. “Before the days of telephones, a call boy’s job was to roust train crews and let them know when their next run would be,” noted local labor historian and community leader Mike Matejka in his 1989 biographical sketch of Morrissey. “This included rapping on bedroom windows in the middle of the night, or tracking down trainmen at restaurants, poker games or taverns.” Morrissey graduated from Bloomington High School in 1879. There were 27 students in his graduating class and he was one of only five males. He then made his way to Chicago where he worked for a grocer, though he was soon drawn back to Bloomington’s west side and the world of railroading. By 1880 he was a clerk to a C&A master mechanic, while his later jobs included freight brakeman and conductor. In this age of raw capitalism workers were often treated as little more than expendable parts in a cruel industrial and commercial machine designed to concentrate wealth into the hands of the robber baron class. This was the Gilded Age, a time of vast economic inequality unmatched in U.S. history (until today that is!) In this unregulated economic order there were few livelihood’s as dangerous as that of a railroad brakemen. In an era before air brakes, this job entailed traversing a moving train topside and setting brakes for each railcar out in the raw elements. Imagine doing that job atop a swaying, jostling train, to say nothing of facing heavy winds, rain, ice or snow. Brakemen were also responsible for coupling and uncoupling cars using the dangerous link-and-pin system. This action required brakemen to stand between two rail cars and guide an elongated iron loop or link from one car to the coupler pocket of the other. As the link and pocket were drawn together the brakeman would drop an iron pin into an opening of the now-joined loop and coupler to hold them together. Needless to say, this was as dangerous as it sounds. Brakemen often caught their fingers or entire hand in the coupler, or we’re crushed between the cars. “A supervisor could hire experienced trainmen by the number of fingers missing,” added Matejka. Federal and state workers’ compensation did not exist when Morrissey began his railroading career, and private insurers often refused to cover such dangerous occupations. Thus the early railroad unions known as brotherhoods, including Morrissey’s Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen (BRT), doubled as mutual insurance societies. Organized along job type—engineers, firemen, conductors, brakemen—brotherhoods were a hybrid of fraternal society and labor union. At a time when workers had few rights or protections that would allow them to organize and strike, the brotherhoods were relatively conservative, preferring “to establish mutual confidence, and create and maintain harmonious relations” between the owners and producers of capital. Brakemen organized a brotherhood in 1883, and two years later Morrissey and about 30 other local brakemen and switchmen became charter members of the Bloomington lodge (as chapters or locals were known). Elected later that year to attend the brotherhood’s third national convention, Morrissey impressed the newly elected grand master enough to be offered a job at the brotherhood’s national office in Galesburg, Ill. In 1890, the Brotherhood of Railroad Brakemen became the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen so it could represent a wider range of rail and yard positions, including conductors, baggage handlers, ticket collectors, flagmen and dining car stewards. Four years later, in 1894, the American Railway Union (ARU) staged a strike against the Pullman Palace Car Co., a Chicago maker of railroad sleeping cars. The strike’s determined leader was Eugene V. Debs, a former secretary of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen who believed that an industry wide union such as the ARU would better serve the interests of railroad workers. The more cautious Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen opposed the ARU and even booted members who supported the Pullman Strike. When a 32-year-old Morrissey took the reins of the BRT in 1895 the organization was in “deep distress.” The Panic of 1893 (“panic” was a once-popular term for a steep economic downturn) and the Pullman Strike had decimated the brotherhood’s membership rolls and finances. During Morrissey’s 14 years as grand master, the BRT returned to national prominence and continued its evolution from fraternal society to labor union. His regime likely made its greatest mark by negotiating standardized railroad wages and working conditions within regions of the country. And under his leadership the brotherhood’s membership increased from 10,000 to 120,000. The former Bloomington brakeman’s willingness to bridge the gap between big business and organized labor made him a trusted ally of Progressive Era President Theodore Roosevelt, who proved far more supportive of labor than most of his fellow Republicans. “The only prominent labor leader I ever met who was as good a citizen, as good an advisor politically, and as broad and practical a worker for social justice as the best of our people generally, was Patrick Morrissey,” Roosevelt wrote to British statesman Winston Churchill. Morrissey stepped down as head of the BRT in 1909. He passed away on Nov. 28, 1916, at his Galesburg home, the cause of death said to be a brain tumor. He was 54 years old. Long afterward Morrissey remained a beloved figure of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen. During World War II the BRT succeeded in getting a Liberty ship (a famed class of cargo vessel) named for their former grand master. The “S.S. Patrick H. Morrissey” was christened Dec. 7, 1943, at Brunswick, Ga.",

    "content": "The War to End All Wars, as the First World War was once called, brought out the best and the worst in Americans. On the home front, “superpatriot” officials and mobs hounded and persecuted the nation’s (and Bloomington’s) large German-American population into surrendering the use of the German language in their newspapers, schools, churches and club meetings. In the Central Illinois countryside, Mennonites were taunted and humiliated (and occasionally hauled before federal investigators) for their pacifist beliefs. Yet despite such ugliness, there was also an outpouring of support and a generosity of spirit when it came to hunger in German-occupied Belgium, privations in the “devastated districts” of France, and the destitution faced by widowed mothers and children from those two Western European nations. The Commission for Relief in Belgium was a rare humanitarian success story in an incomprehensibly appalling war that left nearly 20,000 British dead in one single day on the Somme battlefield. International relief efforts for Belgium were headed by Herbert Hoover, the future U.S. president. In Bloomington, a French-Belgian Allied Relief Association spearheaded local charity efforts. Organized and managed by women, the success of this association spoke to the enormous, often-untapped potential of half the nation’s population constricted by patriarchal mores and laws. At this time women were rarely steered toward fulfilling careers in government, business or science. And when they were afforded such opportunities they faced barriers aplenty. Furthermore, women would not gain the constitutional right to vote until 1920, and not surprisingly, they were afforded little say when it came to the big public issues of the day. In the local press, married women—even those in leadership positions—were always identified, yoke-like, by their husband’s first name. It was “Mrs. G.B. Read,” for instance, and never Dottie Reed. Bloomington-Normal was home to a sizable number (relative to the community’s population) of well-educated middle class and upper-middle class women. Much of their energy was channeled into an innumerable number of literary societies, history clubs, reading circles, charitable associations, spirited teas and the like. Unfortunately, these groups were racially and socioeconomically segregated with few if any women of color or those from working-class backgrounds. That said, there were African-American social, educational and charitable clubs and organizations, and they accomplished much good work independently of their vastly more privileged peers. The driving force behind local French-Belgian relief efforts was the aforementioned Dottie Read, whose husband G.B. “Bert” Read was president and treasurer of Bloomington-based Portable Elevator Manufacturing Co. Well before the United States entered the war in April 1917, Dottie took it upon herself to visit humanitarian relief offices in Chicago in preparation for doing much the same in Bloomington. Her first major project was making pajamas for French soldiers in 1916. In the fall of the following year, Read brought together a group of women to make clothing for civilians in France and elsewhere battered by the war. Two rooms in her East Jefferson Street residence were repurposed for such work. By October 1917 Read and her sewing circle had made 45 complete children’s outfits and hundreds of other garments for shipment overseas. The French-Belgian Allied Relief Association, established around this time and headed by Read, grew out of these early efforts (It’s always nice to be reminded that one individual can indeed make a difference!) The association maintained office and work space in downtown Bloomington. “Church aid societies, clubs, lodges, leagues, thimble societies, etc.” all scheduled work time in this space to sort, measure, cut, sew and pack everything from women’s dresses to baby bootees. Other care package items, such as shoes and soap, were donated to, or purchased by, the association. French-Belgian relief fundraisers included a garden party at Bloomington Country Club, and a two-day “lawn fete” and dance at “The Oaks,” the mid-19th century mansion on the 300 block of East Grove Street. A parallel relief program, the Fatherless Children of France Committee, was led by Edith Davis, wife of David Davis II, grandson of U.S. Supreme Court Justice David Davis. Area residents were asked to adopt French or Belgian “orphans” (though many of these children still had mothers). Adoption in this case meant financial support or sponsorship of a child for one year at a cost of $36.50, the equivalent of nearly $600 today, adjusted for inflation. “Liberty cannot survive unless France survives; France cannot survive unless her children are saved,” declared The Pantagraph in its spirited defense of the child sponsorship program. On July 13, 1918, local French-Belgian relief events included a French marketplace and sidewalk cafe (a la “Gay Paree”) on the west side of the courthouse square in downtown Bloomington. That same evening there was a “pavement dance” on the 1200 block of East Jefferson Street. Booths with refreshments were located along residential driveways, and lights were strung down the middle of the street. The French market netted $582 for relief efforts and the pavement dance an impressive $1,070.52. On Oct. 1, a war relief shop was opened in the Irvin Theater building on East Jefferson Street. The gift shop featured “unusually dainty and pretty handmade fancy work” from local women, including greeting cards, handkerchiefs, baby clothes and hand-painted luncheon sets. Such fundraising work did not end with the silencing of guns that came with the November 11, 1918 armistice. Charitable activities continued through the winter of 1918-1919 and into the spring. In January 1919, for example, the French-Belgian aid association spent $1,500 for blankets. It seemed as if there was always someone or some group working on relief. The delightfully named As You Like It Club, to cite one example, held a lunch in late January 1919 “tying comforts” (securing the back of a quilt to the top with yarn) destined for Europe. Although the French and Belgian-Allied Relief Association formally closed up shop on Mar. 28, 1919, donations continued to arrive. In early April, the relief committee in Cropsey, a tiny community in the northeast corner of McLean County, concluded 14 months of work, highlights of which included sponsorship of an orphan and the making and gathering of some 1,400 articles of clothing. All told, McLean County residents sent some 60,000 garments overseas. The county also sponsored more than 465 orphans, exceeding its quota by nearly 180. When it came to World War I relief, McLean County outpaced all but Cook among the state’s 102 counties “in the volume of shipments and in other active ities.” For her part in the terrible war, local relief organizer Dottie Read received a medal of recognition from Princess Henriette of Belgium.",

    "content": "Bloomington writer Harold Sinclair always looked a little out of place, whether it was standing in the middle of John Wayne and filmmaker John Ford (pictured here), or as a middle-aged man peddling his bicycle to old Withers Library wearing sandals and Bermuda shorts. Though at times a little too idiosyncratic for staid Bloomington, Sinclair was a bona fide literary talent who—while never living up to his early promise—produced several finely crafted works of fiction. Once such success was “Horse Soldiers,” released in 1956 to become Sinclair’s lone bestseller. Brought to the silver screen by Ford and two of the era’s biggest box office draws, John Wayne and William Holden, the film was a loose adaptation of his popular Civil War novel. Earning a screenplay credit, Sinclair visited the Louisiana set in late 1958. He was astonished by the scale of the then-pricey $6.5 million production. “I told ‘Duke’ Wayne that it was confusion and ‘Duke’ said it was organized confusion,” mused Sinclair. “Horse Soldiers” was a fictional account of Grierson’s Raid, a Union cavalry advance deep into Confederate territory during Gen. Ulysses S. Grant’s 1863 Vicksburg campaign. This Civil War yarn was a perfect fit for Ford, whose legendary reputation rested in great part on his mastery of the Western, manifest in a dozens of his films, including “Stagecoach” (1939), “She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,” (1949) and his magnum opus, “The Searchers” (1956). It was also no accident that John Wayne, who enjoyed a long and productive relationship with the cantankerous filmmaker, starred in these three films, as well as many others in the Ford canon. A voracious reader who dropped out of Bloomington High School, Sinclair played the Bohemian in his twenties, with stops in Ocala, Florida and Chicago. He eventually returned to Bloomington and settled down to a life divided between workaday drudgery (including factory work during World War II) and late night writing sessions, fueled in no small part by alcohol and jazz music. Although “Horse Soldiers” was Sinclair’s best-selling book, his most ambitious literary achievement was a semi-fictional trilogy—“American Years” (1938), “Years of Growth” (1940), and “Years of Illusion” (1941)—on early Bloomington history. The downstate premiere of “Horse Soldiers” was held in July 1959 at the Castle Theater. Bloomington Mayor Robert McGraw signed a proclamation declaring “Harold Sinclair Day,” and the Duke himself sent a telegram of regret that he could not attend the screening. Sinclair battled alcoholism much of his adult life, compelling his wife Ethel, the longtime librarian for The Pantagraph , to serve as the family’s main breadwinner. Sadly, “Horse Soldiers” was disappointment, garnering little box office buzz and nary an Academy Award nomination. The principals involved in “The Horse Soldiers,” though, found Oscar glory elsewhere. Holden received three best actor nominations, winning once. Wayne, nominated twice, finally picked up an Oscar near the end of his acting days. Ford, on the other hand, garnered four best director awards during a career that spanned six decades. And as for Sinclair, his follow-up novel to the “The Horse Soldiers” was met with critical and popular indifference, and he turned increasingly to the bottle. Cancer then cut his life short in 1966. He was only fifty-nine.",

    "content": "One of the more striking modern day conveniences we take for granted is the ease of long distance travel. Before commercial airlines, concrete highways and railroads, there were stagecoach lines. What now takes hours would take days as stages, pulled by teams of four and sometimes six horses, bumped to and fro down impossibly rutted “roads,” waded through seemingly bottomless mud, crossed low-lying prairies transformed into shallow lakes, and forded roiling, swollen streams. Writing in 1910, local historian Dwight E. Frink noted that the stage era was short-lived in Illinois. The latter 1840s marked the “palmy days” of the stage in the Prairie State, but the emergence of “Titan power” (that is, the steam locomotive) marked the beginning of the end for long-distance travel by flesh-and-blood horsepower. Throughout the settlement period, most pioneers journeyed by wagon or horseback. Stagecoaches, however, filled a transportation niche for businessmen, visitors from the East, elected officials and others. Stage lines were also the primary carrier of U.S. mail. In Bloomington, the main stage route ran east-west, from Danville to Peoria and / or Pekin. Before railroads, stage and steamer lines were often linked. The Pekin wharf, for instance, gave travelers access to not only navigable stretches of the Illinois River, but the Mississippi and Ohio rivers as well. The main Chicago-to-St. Louis stage line bypassed Bloomington in favor of Peoria. That said, there was local stage traffic running north-south that connected Bloomington with either Decatur or Springfield, though service to those communities was irregular. The most dominant Midwestern stage line was Chicago-based Frink & Walker (later Frink & Co., sans Walker). Formally established in 1840, John Frink (no known relation to local historian Dwight Frink) and Martin Walker’s company operated a main terminal at the corner of Dearborn and Lake streets in downtown Chicago. In late July 1851, The Weekly Western Whig, a Bloomington newspaper that predated The Pantagraph, announced that Frink & Co. was now running a “splendid” stage from Bloomington to Urbana, and that westbound service would now run directly to Pekin, rather than first stopping in Peoria. “Persons now coming from Ohio and Indiana, will find this route the most direct, convenient and comfortable one that now crosses this state,” read the notice. Frink & Walker sometimes faced competition from local operators. One early settler remembered Bloomington Judge John E. McClun wresting away the Danville-to-Peoria mail contract from a stage line (presumably Frink’s). There were also local freight haulers, like Bloomington’s William G. Boyce, who served as over-the-road truckers of the pioneer era. Stagecoach bodies were supported by leather straps, known as “thoroughbraces,” that served as shock absorbers. Many stages that crisscrossed Illinois were nine-passenger, four-horse “post coaches” manufactured by Abbot and Downing of Concord, NH. These coaches could accommodate a tenth passenger—if they didn’t mind riding atop with the driver! According to historian Dwight Frink, the first “real coaches” in Bloomington (“swung by four massive straps above a sturdy gear”) appeared in the late 1840s. Travel conditions were unpleasant at best and appalling at worst, and the trials and tribulations of stage passengers is a lively sub-genre of frontier literature. For example, a July 16, 1836 letter (written in Latin but later translated into English) by Jesuit Father Pierre Verhaegen to his superior in Rome detailed a dreadful (though altogether unremarkable) stage trip from St. Louis to Springfield. Father Verhaegen’s six-seat coach, crammed with nine passengers, was no match for a prairiescape dotted with stagnant water. The riders, already tormented by gnats, had to disembark and “proceed on foot through horrid places if they would not see the coach sink in the mud.” And at a crude wayside, eight men, including Father Verhaegen, shared four beds in a 20x20 foot square room. Traveling one night, the stage hit a steer lying in the road. When the wounded steer’s horns became entangled in the reins of a tripped-up horse, the near-disaster of a runaway stage was averted only when passengers leapt from the topsy-turvy coach to steady the “foaming steeds.” J.S. Buckingham, in his multi-volume travelogue published in 1842, recounted a stage stop twelve miles out of Chicago. During the change of coaches, he recounted, “we had to wait in the bar-room of one of the most filthy and wretched houses we had yet seen … the hideous-looking bar-keeper appeared like a man who never washed or combed, and none of whose garments had ever been changed since he had first put them on;—altogether nothing could be more revolting.” William H. Milburn, a blind Methodist preacher, recalled an 1846 journey from Chicago through Peru, Peoria, Bloomington and beyond. Eleven miles east of “Peory,” with Milburn and his wife the sole passengers, the stage company swapped out its four-horse coach for an uncovered two-horse wagon. Once in Bloomington, Milburn inquired as to hotel accommodations. The driver “assured us that we should get nothing fit to eat,” he recalled, “and that if we attempted to sleep, the bed-bugs would eat us up.” Milburn wisely directed the driver to continue “to the door of the Methodist that lived in the largest and most comfortable house.” The Vale livery stable, located at the northeast corner of East and Front streets in downtown Bloomington (today this site is a surface parking lot), served as a local stage stop in the 1840s, if not a little later. The East Street portion of stable dated to 1846 and the Front Street addition to 1852. In early June 1879, The Pantagraph reported that the two attached buildings, “swaybacked and sprung like old steeds,” would soon be torn down. “Many an exciting scene have they witnessed, and many a thrilling story have they heard related,” mused The Pantagraph of the two buildings. “They have had their day, and are now to pass into the oblivion which has hidden from the world thousands whose footsteps often echoed within their walls.”",

    "content": "Rev. Levi Spencer came to Bloomington in April 1844, and it’s no exaggeration to say that his next four-and-a-half years in McLean County would prove a living hell. During his time here, local residents ostracized, scorned, mocked, vilified, threatened and physically assaulted the good reverend. Spencer’s crime? Advocating the immediate end to slavery and believing in the equality of the races. Even in much of the free North, abolitionists faced a level of vitriol and violence that still has the power to shock. For Spencer, slavery was a “God-hating and soul-destroying system” that corrupted the nation and gave lie to its professed principles. “Liberty? Solemn mockery! Base hypocrisy!” he wrote in his diary on Independence Day, Jul. 4, 1842. “Three million of our fellow men in the most abject bondage, bought and sold like beasts in the market, right under the American flag.” (Spencer’s diaries are held at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library in Springfield.) Born in 1812 in New York, Spencer and his wife Minerva moved to Illinois in 1839. He left the Presbyterian Church over the slavery issue and became a Congregationalist, where his fervent abolitionism came to define his ministry. He served in Canton, Ill. before coming to Bloomington in the spring of 1844. The family’s residence was on the 200 block of East Grove Street, about where A. Gridley Antiques is today. Spencer’s diaries offer a harrowing account of the menacing mobs that abolitionists faced during his years in Bloomington. On May 30, 1846, the anti-slavery society was denied the county courthouse for a meeting space, so instead they gathered at a commercial workshop somewhere in town. There they listened to a speech by Owen Lovejoy, an abolitionist from Princeton, Ill. He was the younger brother of Elijah Lovejoy, who was killed in Alton, Ill. on Nov. 7, 1837 defending his anti-slavery press from a mob. “Brother Lovejoy,” Spencer recorded in his diary, spoke on the great moral, political and religious question of the day—“human rights and our duty to God and the slave.” Near the close of the meeting an ugly crowd gathered outside began pelting the workshop and its windows with eggs. To Spencer’s disgust, those that gave implicit consent to these “base and disgraceful proceedings” included “our officers of the peace (so called) and some leading members in our churches.” Spencer also preached and participated in anti-slavery meetings in Mount Hope and Pleasant Hill, two early communities in McLean County with known sympathies to abolitionism. Both small settlements were also stops on the Underground Railroad. In early October 1843, for example, Spencer was in Mount Hope doing his part to assist three fugitive slaves making their way from the “prison house of bondage” to freedom in Canada. In June 1846, Spencer got word that a Bloomington attorney had offered a $100 reward for anyone who would tar and feather him and then ride him out of town on a rail. At this time, Spencer was despised by the local citizenry for not only his anti-slavery views, but also his vocal and steadfast opposition to the Mexican-American War. As an abolitionist, he viewed the war as little more than an illegal and immoral land grab by slave states to expand their “soul-destroying” institution. There’s more than circumstantial evidence indicating that this unnamed attorney was none other than Asahel Gridley, one of the more influential figures in the growth and development of Bloomington. Gridley, who would go on to make a fortune as a land agent for the Illinois Central Railroad, had such an impact on this area’s early history that there’s a statue of him on the main floor of the McLean County Museum of History. On June 12, 1846, a raucous celebration was held in Bloomington as folks bid farewell to a company of men preparing to enlist in the 4th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment and fight in Mexico. That night, as they were about to leave for Springfield, a dozen or so 4th Regiment recruits ran amok targeting local abolitionists, including Spencer and George Dietrich. Spencer and his family were first terrorized by egg-throwing vandals and then, after midnight, by a large number of thugs prowling about outside their home. At some point they let forth a volley of bricks through several widows causing much property damage, though thankfully there were no injuries to family members huddling in one corner of a room. “O slavery,” Spencer reflected later that day in his diary, “how alarming is thy power, how dangerous and cruel.” Coercion came not only from the rabble, but also from the more respectable corners of the community. “Threats still come to me from a leading member in the M.E. Ch. [Methodist Episcopal Church],” Spencer wrote on June 23, 1846. “He is encouraging mob violence. We know not what to expect. Every noise late at night greatly disturbs my family—Lord protect us.” On Feb. 25, 1847, Asahel Gridley made good on his own threats by assaulting the unarmed minister with a cowhide strap or whip in broad daylight on the “most public street in town.” Gridley got in a good lick or two with the “cow hide” before Spencer wisely retreated. Apart from abolitionism, what had so enraged Gridley was Spencer’s visit to Gridley’s wife Mary and his sister-in-law Juliet Covell. At the Gridley family home, Spencer talked with the two women “about their souls” before ending the session with prayer. Evidently, having an abolitionist preach and pray with family members was too much for the ill-mannered, hot-tempered and abusive patriarch. For his part, Spencer reflexively turned the other cheek. “I had not for a moment a feeling of revenge or retaliation,” he wrote. “I could pray for him better than anything else.” Although the attack “caused much excitement in town,” unsurprisingly, there appears to have been no repercussions, legal or otherwise, for Gridley. Perhaps things cooled down a bit after that, for later that year Spencer observed an increasing tolerance for abolitionists. He happily reported “good attendance” at a Sept. 1, 1847 anti-slavery meeting. “Men are becoming more tame,” he added, “so that they do not as formerly take a fit—go mad and froth and foam as much.” In November 1848, Spencer and his family settled in Peoria, and there he led a Congregational church until his passing in 1853 at the age of 41. The cause of death was said to be tuberculosis. Back in July 1846, during his time in Bloomington, Spencer reflected on the death of a local African-American resident. “Harrison (the colored boy) has gone—yes gone beyond the reach of prejudice and hate.” he wrote. “It is a consolation to know that poverty or color of the skin, nor low condition in this world will form any barrier at Heaven’s Gate!”",

    "content": "In the spring of 1939, area residents flocked to the Bloomington Consistory to gaze upon paintings by the likes of Rembrandt, Renoir and Rubens. The Central Illinois Art Exposition drew national attention, with Time magazine calling it “the biggest and best exhibition of fine paintings ever held in a U.S. city of that size.” It was the greatest art show in Bloomington history. Given the staggering increase in the value of these paintings over the ensuing nearly eight decades, it’s highly unlikely—neigh, unimaginable—that a show of this stature will ever again be mounted in the Twin Cities. The once-in-a-lifetime exhibit featured a little more than 100 paintings from “old and modern masters” and contemporary American artists. The works included Rubens’ “The Bear Hunt,” Toulouse-Lautrec’s “Cirque Medrano,” and even Grant Wood’s “American Gothic.” There were also paintings by Degas, Delacroix, El Greco, Gainsborough, Gauguin, Manet, Modigliani, Monet, Sisley, Tintoretto, Titian, Van Dyck, Thomas Benton, Thomas Eakins, Winslow Homer, Edward Hopper and more. All the works were on temporary loan. The Rubens came from the Silberman Galleries in New York City, for example, and the iconic Wood from the Art Institute of Chicago. Other donors included the Brooklyn Museum; Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; Whitney Museum of Art, New York; and the Carnegie Art Institute in Pittsburgh. “Bespatted legionnaires” with gilded rifles, led by American Legion Commander Art P. Kane, served as the honor guard. Also on hand for round-the-clock watch duty were law enforcement officers from the city and county. The spring 1939 exhibit ran from Mar. 19 through Easter Sunday, Apr. 9, on the lower floor of the Consistory (now the Bloomington Center for the Performing Arts). Admission was 25 cents, which adjusted for inflation would be the equivalent of about $4.50 today. Students, though, were free. Attendance for the three-week show topped 41,000, or almost 2,000 per day, with students comprising about half that number. Illinois State Normal University President Raymond W. Fairchild accepted the chairmanship of the school committee, which contacted 230 downstate school systems. By the end of the exposition, students from 78 communities, including Kewanee, Sibley and Champaign, participated in supervised tours. In order to accommodate the crush of students during the 15 school days of the exposition, organizers guided them through in groups of 50 spaced 10 minutes apart. The driving force behind the exposition was The Pantagraph’s 32-year-old publisher Loring “Bud” Merwin, described by Time magazine as the “green-eyed, dark-headed, infectious Harvardman.” Serving as the show’s general chairman, Merwin envisioned the event as a way to boost the prospects, aesthetically and financially, of Bloomington, which like the country as a whole found itself mired in the decade-long Great Depression. Thus this exposition served not only to bring incomparable works of fine art to the downstate masses, but also to boost community pride and, not inconsequentially, retail sales of downtown merchants. Incredibly, Merwin’s first idea was to bring the “Mona Lisa” to Bloomington! He and Drew Pearson, a Washington, D.C. columnist, proposed such a plan to the French ambassador, but were told that given the time constraints and the red tape, the Leonardo da Vinci masterpiece could not be secured for a temporary trans-Atlantic loan. Alan D. Gruskin of New York City’s Midtown Galleries was brought in to serve as the exposition’s curator. Let it be noted that the collection on exhibit mirrored the 34-year-old Gruskin’s rather conservative taste for academic and realist painters at the expense of abstract art. At first, Gruskin found little interest among leading museums and galleries, both private and public, in participating in the small city show. His first break came when the William Rockhill Nelson Gallery in Kansas City agreed to furnish El Greco’s “The Penitent Magdalene.” Once this gallery signed on, other galleries and institutions followed. To pay for the show, the executive committee received financial commitments totaling around $10,000 from more than 130 mostly local organizations, businesses and individuals, such as the Paul F. Beich Co., Peoples Bank, A. Livingston & Sons and G.J. Mecherle. The two costliest outlays were Consistory rent ($1,225) and Gruskin’s fee ($750). In the end, given the better-than-expected revenue from ticket receipts and the sale of a 10-cent souvenir booklet, the exposition committee ended up returning more than 80 cents of each donated dollar. Effusive praise for the exposition came from middle and highbrow corners alike. National magazines raved about the show. “Finest Art in U.S. Goes to Illinois Corn Belt,” read a Life magazine headline to an article that included photographs by Alfred Eisenstadt. “This is the best show outside of the three or four leading museums in America that I have ever seen,” said Chauncey McCormick, vice president of the Art Institute of Chicago. Others were equally impressed. “Bloomington is the laboratory for a new idea in art, bringing art to the people instead of people to art,” commented critic Peyton Boswell, writing in the Apr. 1, 1939 issue of The Art Digest. He called the effort “one of the most important exhibitions held in America in recent years.” It also dovetailed well with one of the founding principles of The Art Digest—namely, “the decentralization of art production and art consumption away from the narrow ribbon of the Atlantic seaboard, lest American art suffer premature senility.” Even the “shadowless” lighting scheme, billed as state-of-the-art, drew raves. “Blue daylight bulbs and reflectors give uniform lighting to the entire area of each picture twelve hours a day—illumination superior to that in most of the paintings’ home museums and galleries,” noted Newsweek magazine. A special committee purchased one of the paintings on exhibition, Frederick Taubes’ “Seated Woman,” and handed it over to the Bloomington Art Association. Today, this painting is in the permanent collection of the McLean County Arts Center. In the fall of 1989, the Art Center staged a 50th anniversary show of the exposition. Though not as large and ambitious as its predecessor, it did include works on loan by Manet, Toulouse-Lautrec and others.",

    "content": "On May 20, 1897, a heavy afternoon shower accompanied by a “brilliant electrical display” passed through the Lexington area, catching 18-year-old John Hays in open country upon a horse and a dog at his side. Hays, who lived about six miles northwest of Lexington, was a little ways from home when death came calling for him and his companions. “A lightning bolt descended from the clouds and all three were instantly killed,” reported The Pantagraph. “After the storm the boy and the animals were found lying close together.” In “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” Shakespeare wrote of love being, “Brief as the lightning in the collied [coal black] night.” And brilliant though the flash—of love or lightning—may be: The jaws of darkness do devour it up: So quick bright things come to confusion. Although there are no ready statistics available on the number of Central Illinois residents killed by lightning in the 19th century, the assumption among meteorologists and historians is that the fatality rates were higher back then because many more people spent their days working outdoors than they do now. Today’s up-to-the-minute weather reporting and warnings have also likely reduced the number of lightning fatalities. According to figures compiled by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, lightning killed an average of 26 people a year in the U.S. between 2012 and 2018. Most injuries and deaths come not from direct strikes but ground current, such as being near a tree hit by lightning. Incredibly, only about 10 percent of those struck in the U.S. are killed, though survivors often have severe burns, organ damage and long-term or permanent injuries. They can also suffer from difficult-to-diagnose emotional problems. Local dentist Joseph Payne survived a lightning strike on March 28, 1859, while visiting the Stout’s Grove home of J.W. Hanger, located about 14 miles west of Bloomington. A little more than one month later, Payne offered Pantagraph readers a detailed account of his ordeal. He noted that by following the line of splintered and shattered wood from the home’s rafters to its floorboards, one could trace the exact path of the lightning “with as much certainty as a man could be tracked through the snow.” Payne was leaning against a wall with his legs crossed, one foot touching a stove used to heat the room in colder months, when lightning burst through the wall, striking him square in the back. The current ran down the right side of his body, passing to the left side where his legs were crossed, and thence to the stove, shattering the wood box in the process. The strike melted Payne’s keys and watch chain, while the clothes on one side of his body and one boot were blown to bits, The lightning, after continuing into the kitchen and punching two holes in the floor, “exhausted itself in the earth,” but not before killing a dog and four chickens seeking refuge under the home. For about half a minute afterward Payne found himself enveloped in darkness, his head ringing and vibrating “without the slightest sensation of pain, and just sufficient consciousness left to know something had happened.” He woke up flat on the floor, “perfectly paralyzed and my clothing in flames a foot high.” J.W. Hanger attempted to smother the flames with his hands before James Gunnell, another visitor, doused the fire with two buckets of water. In a matter of hours Payne began feeling like himself, though a nasty six-inch-wide burn running from shoulder to knee consigned him to bed for three weeks. Perhaps the most prominent area resident killed by lightning was 46-year-old William H. Hanna, an attorney who dated his practice to the days of Abraham Lincoln and the Eighth Judicial Circuit. On August 5, 1870, around 11 p.m., Hanna and his wife Frances were in their bedroom sleeping though an “extraordinary electrical phenomena” when lightning struck their 209 E. Grove St. home (today this lot is occupied by Beck Memorial Home). With her husband catatonic, a stunned but unharmed Frances roused herself after a few moments to summon for help, though when a doctor arrived William managed but a few final labored breaths before passing away. He showed little outward signs of bodily trauma, with the only visible marks above the shoulder and chest, “neither breaking or abrading the skin.” In an era when horses were ubiquitous and the typical farm raised livestock of all sorts, lightning dispatched animals small and large with a frequency unknown today, at least in Central Illinois. On August 8, 1871, for instance, John Brawderick of Old Town Township found two young horses lying dead in their stalls, victims of a lightning strike. The value of horses was said to be about $300, or nearly $6,300 today, adjusted for inflation. The “fiery fluid” (lightning was often described as such in the 19th century) left its mark when storms swept through the area on June 24, 1880. In the afternoon, lightning in the Hudson area claimed David Smith’s two best milch cows, and that night in Saybrook, lightning sparked a fire that gutted the Lake Erie & Western Railway depot. Lightning never strikes the same place twice, or so goes the oft-repeated myth, but one 19th century McLean County farmer could point to a spot frequented by livestock that was struck not once but three times over a space of three years. In the spring of 1890, J.B. Beckett of Blue Mound Township lost two cows congregating near a 40-foot windmill used to pump water. The previous year lightning claimed two of his mares and a colt at roughly the same spot, and the year before that, in 1888, a fine bull was struck and killed under the windmill. “Mr. Becket has carried stock insurance since the bull was killed,” noted The Pantagraph.",

    "content": "A cataclysmic meteorological event swept across much of Central Illinois the afternoon of Dec. 20, 1836. The “Sudden Change,” as it became known, was a cold front of unprecedented violence, and it so scarred the early settlers who lived to tell the tale that it became one of the defining moments of the pioneer era. Sometime around 2 o’clock on that mild, late-December afternoon more than 180 years ago, McLean County settlers pricked up their ears and took heed of a “raging, roaring, bellowing sound… shaking and pervading the firmament.” This elemental clamor, akin to “distant, heavy cannonading,” heralded the arrival of wrathful cold front worthy of the Old Testament. The front, appearing as a pitch-black (“dark even to blackness,” it was said) bank of roiling, raging clouds, traveled in a south-southeasterly direction at anywhere from 20 to 35 miles per hour. Samuel B. Mead of the western Illinois community of Augusta reported a sunrise temperature of 40 degrees Fahrenheit. By 2:00 p.m., the temperature had plummeted to 0 degrees. Mead’s observations are similar to those recorded by the U.S. Army at Fort Des Moines, Ia., and elsewhere. Yet some Central Illinois settlers claimed, somewhat dubiously, the temperature dropped a full 60 degrees in a mere 15 minutes. In the days preceding the Sudden Change, much of Central Illinois had been blanketed by a snowfall. By the morning of Dec. 19, though warm weather had turned the snow to slush, and then a steady rain began transforming the countryside into a soggy, soupy mess. Also known as the “Sudden Freeze,” this unprecedented Dec. 20, 1830 cold front swept through the state’s midsection, wreaking havoc from Ottawa on the north to Paris, Ill. and Terre Haute, Ind. on the south. “The wind in its fury and power blew the water into little sharply defined waves, which froze as they stood, leaving ponds, creeks and rivers crusted with a heavy coat of ice,” read one representative account. “The sudden freeze of ’36 came with a vengeance,” one aged pioneer related in 1885 to a reporter for The Leader, a long-gone Bloomington newspaper. “It was like a wild prairie fire, which nipped everything in its way, and woe to him who was far away from human habitation, for its bite was ferocious. I was in the country at the time, and I tell you, young man, you will never see such weather if you live a thousand years.” Occurring nearly a half-century after the fact, this account illustrates the pull this event had on the memories (and fervid imaginations) of older settlers. The muddy slush congealed into a sticky mass that weighed down man beast and like. More than one settler relayed the story of encountering the Sudden Change on horseback, and after making the perilous journey to shelter, they found themselves frozen to the saddle, and had to be forcibly wrenched off their steeds with great difficulty. The Sudden Change came six years after the “Winter of Deep Snow,” so-called when a series of storms beginning in mid-December 1830 left snow three to four feet deep until late into the spring of 1831. “The stories and incidents related to this sudden change are never ending, and are more curious and strange even than those of the deep snow,” noted Etzard Duis in his collection of pioneer biographies and sketches, published in 1874 as Good Old Times in McLean County. This mother lode of pioneer lore includes a wealth of Sudden Change anecdotes—some entirely credible; others much less so. As Randolph’s Grove settler Hiram Buck headed home, goes one typical story, the wind “blew out his overcoat and froze it immediately in the shape it took when extended.” Upon reaching his residence, Buck had difficulty pulling himself inside, as his billowed-out, frozen coat couldn’t make it through the door! “Like many stories and incidents connected with the winter of the deep snow,” noted a Pantagraph reporter of the Sudden Change in 1881, “there is a certain degree of exaggeration, which the more sophisticated would call a little ‘fishy,’ and somewhat hard to swallow.” “Cattle froze in their tracks and the terrible change seemed to frighten all the animals and take away their original natures, for they all huddled together, their fear of each other being overcome by their greater fear of the elements around them,” noted one such “fishy” account. “The snapping of forest trees could be heard for nearly three miles,” related one pioneer in a colorful and increasingly fantastical account from 1885. “The bark of dogs froze in solid chunks and fell to the ground, while the lowing of cattle, the grunting of hogs and the distressing cry of fowls filled the air full of icicles.” One unverified story involves a farmer named Williams from eastern McLean County, “frozen so badly that he had to have both of his legs amputated.” He was said to have died several weeks later. Benjamin Wheeler of Hudson Township, along with other settlers, also spoke of a different though equally suspect story involving a father and daughter who succumbed to the cold a few miles from their home. No one, though, seemed to know their names, where they lived, or where they were buried. During the Sudden Change, Henry Welch’s hogs huddled together in their pen, though unbeknownst to their owner, “some half-dozen of them carelessly allowed their tails to droop into the slush and were frozen fast.” The following morning, “he heard discordant sounds coming from the sty, and on going there found it exciting and distressing to see the pigs wriggling to loosen their tails, and squealing most fearfully.” Welch “loosened them by cutting their tails with his knife,” the story concludes, “and they afterwards looked so pretty that he has ever since kept the tails of his pigs clipped short.” Some Sudden Change stories, no matter how far-fetched, deserve repeating. According to one local tall tale, two men were some six miles southeast of Lexington—on their way to buy hogs, it was said—when caught by the deadly cold front. “They saw death before them,” the story goes, “and rather than perish upon the bleak and lonesome prairies they cut for the timber where they soon found two large hollow trees, into which they crawled.” And sure enough, this story doesn’t end well for our travelers. Three years later, a woodsman cutting timber in the area happened upon the two forgotten skeletons in the decayed tree trunks. The shelter they so desperately sought had become their tomb.",

    "content": "On United Nations Day 1963, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Adlai E. Stevenson II didn’t come back to his hometown of Bloomington. Even so, he recorded a special message that was played at a city hall U.N. Day ceremony, and he authored an exclusive Pantagraph column on the challenges facing the international organization. Instead of spending a peaceful Oct. 24 in Bloomington, Stevenson faced an ugly anti-U.N. crowd that night in Dallas, Tex., which was well on its way to becoming known as the “City of Hate.” Stevenson, born in 1900 into McLean County’s most prominent Democratic family, spent his boyhood years in Bloomington. His grandfather, also named Adlai, served as vice president during Grover Cleveland’s second term in the White House. The younger Adlai worked in the Roosevelt administration during the Great Depression and World War II. In 1945, he was part of the U.S. delegation to a U.N. organizing conference in San Francisco. He would later say that he was “one of the jubilant midwives of the United Nations' birth and one of its anxious nurses during infancy.” Stevenson would then earn a national reputation as an eloquent liberal reformer and internationalist, first as Illinois governor (1949-1953) and then twice-nominated Democratic Party standard bearer (1952 and 1956), losing both times to Dwight D. Eisenhower. From 1961 until his death in 1965, Stevenson was U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, serving under John F. Kennedy and then Lyndon B. Johnson. Although his diplomatic life took him from the Manhattan cocktail circuit to the capitals of Europe and elsewhere, Stevenson maintained ties to his boyhood home. His only sibling, Elizabeth “Buffie” Ives, lived in the old family home on East Washington Street. Adlai and Elizabeth were also major shareholders in The Pantagraph, and that arrangement provided the main source of income for most of Adlai’s adult years. He also worked for this newspaper as a reporter and editor in his twenties before heading to Evanston and law school at Northwestern University. Perhaps it was for these reasons that he prepared his special statement to The Pantagraph for U.N. Day, Oct. 24, 1963. In it, he noted the rapid increase in the number of member countries due to the collapse of colonial empires controlling much of Africa and Asia (membership in the 18-year-old world body had increased from 51 nations in 1945 to 111 in 1963, with the number from Africa alone swelling from 4 to 33.) Stevenson did not shy away from acknowledging the many deficiencies and disappointments of the U.N. Yet he always returned to its accomplishments and, most importantly, its promise. “Peoples long divided by race and by political subjugation, with all the lingering resentments that flow from that relationship, now meet in a community of equals at the United Nations,” he wrote. “And that sense of community, tenuous though it may be, is no small element in the peace of this dangerous world.” Little did Pantagraph readers know at the time, but Bloomington’s favorite son was receiving less-than-favorable treatment in the Lone Star State. On Oct. 23, the day before Stevenson’s visit to Dallas to celebrate U.N. Day, right-wing activists gathered under the banner of the National Indignation Convention to hold a counter-protest “United States Day.” The featured speaker was disgraced former Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker, one of the leading far-right conspiracy mongers of the Cold War era. Walker believed Eisenhower and Kennedy were dupes for the communists; the Civil Rights Movement and racial integration a communist plot; and Stevenson and the U.N. symbols of a global communist conspiracy. The day after the anti-U.N. event, handbills appeared in Dallas featuring President Kennedy’s photograph, front and profile, with the words, “Wanted for Treason.” Stevenson ended a busy Oct. 24 in Dallas with a public speech on the U.N. before a large and generally supportive audience, though the applause greeting him included an ominous undercurrent of hissing and catcalls. As he began his talk he was interrupted by Frank McGehee, the founder of the National Indignation Convention. He refused to sit down and allow Stevenson to continue. As police moved toward McGehee he scuffled with a schoolteacher sitting nearby. “Surely my dear friend,” Stevenson said, “I don't have to come here from Illinois to teach Texas manners, do I?” As McGehee was escorted out of the hall Stevenson took one last jab at his tormenter. “For my part,” he added, “I believe in the forgiveness of sin and the redemption of ignorance.” In an attempt to rattle Stevenson, some in the audience employed noisemakers, or began coughing or laughing in unison. “Kennedy will get his reward in hell,” chanted one man who stood up. “Stevenson is going to die. His heart will stop, stop stop. And he will burn, burn burn.” Stevenson forged ahead with his remarks while, unbeknownst to him, some protesters made their way behind stage. Once there they pulled a rope which flipped over a “Welcome Adlai” sign to reveal one hidden behind it. The new sign read “U.N. Red Front.” As scuffles broke out in the crowd Stevenson refused to exit the stage. “I understand that some of these fearful groups are trying to establish a United States Day in competition with United Nations Day,” he told the crowd. “This is the first time I have heard that the United States and the United Nations are rivals.” Stevenson finished his speech to a three-minute ovation, evidence that the protesters were in a minority, albeit a loud and disruptive one. Stevenson then learned some 100 picketers were outside the auditorium and circling his limousine, singing “Dixie” and “Onward, Christian Soldiers.” As he made his way to the limousine there was much shoving and shouting. At one point a placard came down squarely on Stevenson’s head. He reeled back, startled but unhurt. Several protesters also spat on his face. He was asked if some picketers should be arrested. “I don’t want to send them to jail,” he replied. “I want to send them to school.” President Kennedy read about the confrontation the next day and asked White House aide Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. to let Stevenson know “we thought he was great.” At first Stevenson joked about the incident before turning serious. “But, you know, there was something ugly and frightening about the atmosphere,” he told Schlesinger. “Later I talked with some of the leading people there. They wondered whether the president should go to Dallas, and so do I.” On Nov. 22, 1963, four weeks after his visit to Dallas, Stevenson was lunching at the U.N. with a Chilean delegation when he got word Kennedy had been shot.",

    "content": "Today’s larger wind farms can include hundreds of 280-feet tall turbines and cover thousands of acres, generating enough megawatts to power all the homes in the Twin Cities and more. Although generating electricity on this scale is a modern day triumph, harnessing the prairie wind goes back a long way. Before the sleek, modern behemoths of the 21st century there were the much smaller, water-pumping windmills of the 19th century. These older windmills, roughly averaging some 40 feet in height, were well-engineered machines, favored by farmers for their ingenious practicality. They also drew admirers from afar, offering as they do a striking vertical presence in a horizontal world. It’s been more than a century since the heyday of the old water-pumping windmill, though survivors, many in various stages of neglect, can still be seen scattered hither and yon throughout Central Illinois. The first such windmills were developed in the mid-1850s by Connecticut machinist Daniel Halladay. They differed dramatically, both in form and function, from traditional European windmills (think Don Quixote) built and operated to mill grain—hence the “mill” in windmill. In contrast, American windmills, often called wind engines, were used almost exclusively to pump water from groundwater wells for livestock and household needs. The golden age for water-pumping windmills on the Corn Belt stretched from the 1880s into the 1920s. One can track the early rise of these “wind pumps” in McLean County by examining two 19th century sources. Of the 50-plus detailed lithographic illustrations of farmsteads in the 1874 Atlas of McLean County, only two feature windmills. Yet thirteen years later, in the 1887 Portrait and Biographical Album of McLean County (see accompanying image), windmills are visible in about 25 of the some 85 farm illustrations. The American windmill is a relatively simple yet elegant machine. Most feature a light tower frame (or derrick) of four sloping legs. The fan, usually comprised of curved steel blades in a rosette pattern, sits on a platform atop this tower. Unlike its Old World counterparts, the American or “prairie” windmill is self-governing. This means the fan automatically rotates with favorable shifts in wind. The rotating blades and their maximum speed are also kept in check to prevent the whole mechanism from being shaken apart by centrifugal forces during extremely high winds. A gearbox and crankshaft convert the rotary motion of the fan into reciprocating vertical strokes of a pumping rod, which runs the length of the tower down to the terra firma and the groundwater well. Early windmills had open gearboxes that required farmers to scale their towers every few days to lubricate the contact points, a laborious and dangerous chore that led to a fair number of serious accidents and more than a few fatal falls. The development of enclosed or “self-oiling” gearboxes, in which the moving parts were bathed in light lubricating oil, was a major timesaver and safety improvement, for they required servicing but once or twice a year. Illinois was a major state for windmill manufacturing, with Batavia as the undisputed center. Windmill inventor Daniel Halladay’s company, the U.S. Wind Engine & Pump Co., relocated from New England to Batavia in order to be closer to its emerging markets in the Corn Belt and Great Plains. Batavia, straddling DuPage and Kane counties west of Chicago, would earn the nickname “Windmill City.” Windmills were first constructed of wood. The use of galvanized steel, which came into widespread use in the 1890s, revolutionized the industry. In the early 20th century, Palmer-Darnall Co., 209-211 E. Front St. in downtown Bloomington, acted as a dealer for Chicago-based Aermotor Windmill Co., one of the nation’s leading manufacturers (Aermotor still makes windmills, though the company is now based in San Angelo, Tex.) And in the summer of 1902, Charles A. Downs, as travelling agent for the U.S. Wind Engine & Pump Co., set up shop at a downtown Bloomington hotel to take orders for immediate delivery. Downs advertised several of the company’s windmill models, including the Halladay, Comet, Gem and Standard. The coming obsolesce of the windmill on the Corn Belt can be glimpsed in an advertisement for gasoline-powered pumps in the March 1, 1911 Farmers Voice, a Bloomington-based weekly. “The farm pump engine is fast supplanting windmills in every part of the country,” declared Fuller & Johnson Mfg. Co. of Madison, Wis. Unlike windmills, dependent as they are on the vagaries of Mother Nature, the farm pump could operate 365 days a year. Fuller & Johnson asked farmers to consider purchasing “such an engine for less than the cost of an unreliable, lazy, rickety, dangerous windmill!” The death knell for the windmill came in the form of the Rural Electric Act, which in the late 1930s brought electricity to Corn Belt farms. And with electricity came not only electric lights but electric pumps, which soon supplanted windmills as the power source of choice for farmers needing to pull groundwater up to the surface. A 1969 survey of the rural McLean County landscape identified 304 standing windmills, though not a single one was in operation. Even so, as testament to their simplicity of form and sound engineering, “the general condition [of many] was surprisingly good.” At the time, a few had even been repurposed as television antennas. Windmills are still manufactured in the American Southwest, where they are used by mainly by remote livestock operators pumping water and aerating ponds. There are those with an interest in preserving and restoring Midwestern windmills. Paul Behrends of rural Foosland, a village in Champaign County, operates Paul’s Windmill & Crane Service. Behrends, whose great uncle was an executive vice president of Aermotor Windmill Co., is a “full-time windmiller,” having sold, serviced and installed them throughout the Midwest for a quarter century. On April 6, 1858, Abraham Lincoln debuted a curious lecture he called “Discoveries and Inventions” at Centre Hall in Bloomington (a year later, poor attendance led to the cancellation of a repeat performance!) In this lecture, Lincoln’s observations of, and speculations on, wind power, though far from novel, were certainly prescient. “Of all the forces of nature, I should think the wind contains the largest amount of motive power—that is, power to move things,” he declared. Yet apart from sailing vessels and a “few windmills, and pumps … no very successful mode of controlling, and directing the wind, has been discovered.” Concluded Lincoln: “The wind is an untamed, and unharnessed force; and quite possibly one of the greatest discoveries hereafter to be made, will be the taming, and harnessing of the wind.”",

    "content": "Editor's note: This is Bill Kemp's 650th original \"Page from Our Past\" column. Bill began writing this weekly series on local history back in December 2005. For much of its history, Normal could hardly be described as a “twin city” of Bloomington. In 1870, for instance, there were only 1,116 Normalites, or just 7 percent of Bloomington-Normal’s combined population, which was 15,706 back then. By 1900, the town’s population had grown to nearly 3,800, but that was still just 14 percent of the combined total of 27,081. In fact, the town didn’t start to grow in any appreciable sense until the 1960s. Today, Normal accounts for about 40 percent of the Twin City’s population of more than 132,000, making it a true “twin” of Bloomington. Perhaps Normal’s small size, historically speaking, helps explain why for years town officials depended on a group of no-nonsense, strong-willed, civic-minded women to organize and fund the town’s garbage collection and park and recreation programs. Established on Jan. 30, 1907, the Normal Women’s Improvement League made an immediate impact by organizing clean-up days and regularly scheduled garbage pickup in a town that had never had much of either. During the early 20th century, there was a progressive push to promote hygiene and municipal sanitation as a means to reduce the spread of disease and promote a healthy citizenry. Remarkably, refuse collection and garbage pickup remained the Women’s Improvement League’s responsibility until 1919, when the town finally assumed this most basic of municipal services. Bloomington-Normal, with its comfortable number of educated and well-off women through the years, has long been home to dozens of vibrant societies and clubs active in community betterment and the wider world. Back in the late 19th and early 20th century, at a time when the social, economic and political lives of women were greatly circumscribed by the patriarchy, their incredible reservoir of human capital—dynamic, empathetic, intellectual and powerful—was often channeled into community orientated causes and campaigns. Leadership in the Normal Women’s Improvement League, as with most local clubs and societies from the period, was all-white and skewed toward the upper middle-class. One of the founders and longtime officers was Fannie C. Fell, youngest daughter of Normal’s “first family,” Jesse and Hester Fell. Early members included Matilda Hildebrandt of Hildebrandt’s Drug Store, a fixture in uptown Normal for several decades; Margaret Van Leer, who with her husband Bird Calladay (B.C.) Van Leer, lived at Broadview Mansion on Fell Avenue; and Jennie Gowdy, a well-to-do widow from the Minneapolis, Minn., area who likely came to Normal to be with her daughter Chestine, an ISNU teacher. Privileged though these women were, let it be said that they weren’t afraid to get their hands dirty. And anyway, there was more to the Women’s Improvement League than picking up garbage. For instance, from its very beginning the league sponsored school-age gardening programs, which dovetailed well with its interrelated goals of promoting good citizenship and town beautification. Among its many early activities, there was an annual tulip show in the spring, followed in the fall by one for asters. The third annual schoolchildren’s aster show was held in mid-September 1909 at Normal city hall (this building still stands, though today it’s the two-story side of the popular uptown eatery D.P. Dough.) “There were 117 entries,” reported The Pantagraph, “and the flowers were all beautiful, showing that the children had taken great care and interest in the planting and raising of them.” Birds alighting in Normal also had a reliable ally in the Women’s Improvement League, as increasing the size of the “feathered tribe” was another of its longstanding goals. A rummage sale in the spring of 1914, for example, raised money to purchase a number of bird fountains and baths, which were then placed about town. In 1916, the league organized Normal’s first Boy Scout troop. They did so by raising funds to hire a troop leader, though with the understanding that the local scouts were to assist the league in its ongoing sanitation work. Other than garbage collection, the improvement league made its biggest mark with Fell Park, Normal’s oldest public space. For years, miserly town officials all but neglected the square. “The plat of ground has been called a park for years, but never gave one that impression when looking at it,” noted a disapproving Pantagraph in the spring of 1909. “The park as it now stands is useless except that it contains the Normal water tower. A few trees are scattered around the area and the lawn is uncared for.” From its establishment onward, the Normal Women’s Improvement League was the leading advocate for the underutilized space, though its membership had little success getting the tight-fisted town to do much of anything. Eventually, these frustrated women took matters into their own hands. From 1922 to 1955, with the exception of a few years in the 1930s, the league organized, paid for and operated supervised play programs and other recreation activities at Fell Park. Each season the league hired one or sometimes two playground supervisors, who were most often female physical education majors from ISNU. Initially, the town did little more than keep the grass cut and provide water for the drinking fountain. Funds to support Fell Park programs were raised through various means, including semi-annual paper drives. In Nov. 1930, during the Great Depression, the league collected 5 truckloads of paper worth $20, or more than $300 today, adjusted for inflation. The Normal Women’s Improvement League ran the playground and other recreation programs (such as a children’s theater) until 1956 when the town—at long last—began devoting public dollars and resources to a newly established parks department. Ongoing education of its membership was another of the league’s missions. Several weeks after that Nov. 1930 paper drive, the women welcomed Helen Palmer, resident psychologist at the Illinois Soldiers’ Orphans’ Home in Normal, to speak to them about “juvenile criminality.” Highlights of the league’s many successes over the years include everything from purchasing 17,000 tulip bulbs to donating $8,000 for a theft-proof book return box for Normal Public Library. Yet by the late 20th century, with an aging membership base and the increasing difficulty attracting new members, the decision was made to disband the league during its centennial year. Accordingly, the end came in late June 2007, 100 years after its establishment, with a coterie of longtime members gathered at Fell Park (where else?) to reminisce and share happy and bittersweet memories of all they accomplished over the years. The league is gone but its legacy remains, and one cannot recount the history of the town of Normal without giving due credit to the Women’s Improvement League.",

    "content": "The life and times of Bloomington-born Gordon William “Pawnee Bill” Lillie show us that when it comes to the Wild West, it’s often hard to separate the myths from the real-world events. “When the legend becomes fact, print the legend,” was the way it was put in the John Ford western “The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.” Pawnee Bill ventured out West in the late 1870s, spending several years living what was once called the “picturesque” life—one filled with high adventure on horseback, shooting buffalo and befriending Native Americans. Yet as early as 1883, he embarked on a career as a Wild West showman, helping stage fanciful recreations of the days, apparently not so long ago, when the “noble savage,” the cowboy and the outlaw roamed the trackless plains. Lillie was born in Bloomington on Valentine’s Day 1860, growing up on what’s today West MacArthur Avenue (the house still stands). It was said that before venturing westward, “he had never ridden a horse or shot a gun.” Interviewed in 1940, Lillie recalled that as a youth he was so frail that a friend’s father, a butcher, tried to toughen him up by having him drink the warm blood of freshly slaughtered beef cattle. While still a teenager, Lillie taught for a while at Brush College, the whimsical name of a one-room school in Arrowsmith Township west of Bloomington. “The school had a bad reputation, teachers sometimes lasted but a few days,” recounted one county schools superintendent. Lillie promised to handle the situation or forgo his pay, and on his first day the “tough boys and bullies” who controlled the rural school confronted him in a manner most unfriendly. “The 17-year-old teacher warned them, but they heeded not,” the story goes. Lillie then “rushed the leader grabbing him by the long hair, threw him to the center of the room just missing a red-hot stove. After the third boy hit the floor, all was quiet.” Lillie’s father left for Kansas around this time to establish a milling business, promising to send for the family once he settled in. Lillie, apparently infatuated with the West by this time, couldn’t wait. “I ran off from home and by freight trains, wagons and on foot, made my way to the Indian Territory [Oklahoma],” he later recalled. According to one retelling of his early years in the wild and wooly southern Great Plains (and there are several competing versions), Lillie worked for a trapping outfit shooting buffalo. After a year playing his part in the near-extirpation of the American bison (a role he later came to regret), Lillie found his life’s calling among the Pawnee, learning their language and eventually becoming an interpreter and secretary for a government Indian agent. This also being the Wild West of legend and lore, it’s said that once, while caught in a winter storm hauling hides and furs, he found shelter with the Jesse James Gang. His adventures were also said to include “a narrow escape from a small band of Comanche Indians and deliverance from death beneath the hoofs of a huge heard of buffalo.” In 1883 Lillie caught on as a Pawnee interpreter for William \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody’s traveling Wild West show, and the stage name “Pawnee Bill” would accompany Lillie the remainder of his long life. “In this way I drifted into the show business,” he wrote. Five years later, in 1888, Lillie organized his own traveling show, which, like its many competitors, was similar to an outdoor circus, only instead of clowns and acrobats it showcased cowboys and Indians. By the end of his show business career he had taken his Wild West troupe throughout the United States, much of Canada, as well as overseas to places such as Belgium, Holland and France. Interestingly, Lillie was not the only Wild West showman from McLean County. There was also Charles Jesse Jones, born in 1844 in Money Creek Township. “Buffalo” Jones, as he was known, was a Great Plains trailblazer, breeder of buffalo, consort to European royalty, Arctic explorer and cowboy of the East African Serengeti. Pawnee Bill’s show came to Bloomington on several occasions. In August 1898, for instance, Lillie arrived in town with 300 performers and 58 Native Americans in tow, as well as 150 horses, costumes, elaborate props, canvas tents and all the accoutrements required of such entertainments. Staged at the Illinois Wesleyan University ball field, the outdoor extravaganza featured a series of theatrically staged vignettes, including a band of Sioux attacking a Deadwood, SD stagecoach, a settler’s wagon, and a shack, only to be repelled each time. For the horse thief act, “a real human being was lassoed and dragged by a galloping horse across the park.” Other performances included Lillie’s wife Mary Emma, who “did some fancy shooting . . . breaking discs while at full speed on horseback.” In March 1900, Miller Park, which kept a menagerie of animals (this was prior to the official establishment of the zoo), sold Lillie an ill-tempered buffalo for use in his traveling show. Five months later this “big rusty fellow” met a sad ending in Frankfort, Ind., when a center tent pole gave way during a rainstorm and landed on its back. “Mr. Lillie at once sent the head and a portion of the massive shoulders to Chicago to be stuffed,” it was reported. That same summer of 1900, former Bloomington resident Erle H. Fuller wrote The Pantagraph detailing his life as a “rough rider” in Pawnee Bill’s show. He said a recent afternoon performance in Pittsburgh drew 12,000 paid spectators, with another 2,000 turned away due to lack of seating, and that President William McKinley was in the audience for an earlier show in Canton, OH. The shows four-legged performers included “200 fine horses, 2 buffalo, a drove of steer and ‘donks.’” Lillie merged his Wild West show with \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody’s in 1908, and the “Two Bill’s” remained partners through 1913. During this partnership Lillie completed his dream home, an imposing 14-room Arts and Crafts bungalow on Blue Hawk Peak, which overlooks the small community of Pawnee, Okla. Surrounding the house was a working ranch and what was claimed as the largest private bison herd in the world. Gordon Lillie passed away at his ranch on February 3, 1942, less than two weeks before his 82nd birthday. Today the Pawnee Bill Ranch and Museum is open to the public, and visitors can tour the stone bungalow which still contains original family furnishings. Each year in June, Lillie’s old Wild West show is brought back to life in all its peculiar glory.",

    "content": "Winning a war is not only about killing—it’s also about saving lives, especially if those lives are wounded soldiers fighting on your side. It’s safe to say that no McLean County resident saved more lives in World War II—or any other war, for that matter—than Dr. Edward Delos (“E.D.”) Churchill. Born and raised in the small northern McLean County community of Chenoa, Churchill played an instrumental role in improving medical care for U.S. and Allied troops—especially in the area of wound management and whole blood transfusions. Before and after the war, Churchill—with his deep professional ties to Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital—garnered laurels for achieving a series of medical advances. His accomplishments included groundbreaking thoracic surgery relating to the lung, and the use of lobectomies (the removal of part—or all—of an organ) in the treatment of lung cancer and tuberculosis. And he performed the first operation in the U.S. for relief of constricting pericarditis (whereby the membrane sack around the heart interferes with blood flow.) Churchill credited his Central Illinois upbringing for shaping his character and instilling positive traits such as self-confidence and steadfastness. “Because it was of this stuff we were all made,” he said. “Fortunate breaks in opportunity did the rest.” Born Christmas Day 1895, he was the third and youngest child of Ebenezer Delos (who also went by E.D.) and Maria Farnsworth Churchill. The family was in the grain business, operating elevators in Chenoa and outlying communities and railroad sidings Although Dr. Churchill went on to achieve fame in the rarefied air of the Boston-Cambridge medical establishment, he was just another kid when growing up in Chenoa. “Other of his friends remember that he was usually one of the gang when they raided apple trees and grape vines,” reported The Pantagraph in a 1955 feature titled “That Freshman of Yesteryear.” His staunch Presbyterian parents “would probably have been appalled had they known this,” it was further observed. “But who knows? Experiences with green apples and grapes might have started his medical career.” A sixteen-year-old “Pete” Churchill (as he was known) graduated from Chenoa High in 1912—“not a valedictorian,” it was said, “but ranking high in his class.” At the graduation exercises, he wore knee-length trousers, while the other, older boys sported long pants. “A few classmates remember him as being rather small in stature and spritely. Another remembered him as mischievous.” From Chenoa Churchill headed to Northwestern University, earning a BS in 1916 and an MS the following year. After that it was a medical degree at Harvard, graduating cum laude in 1920. In 1943, with war raging across the globe, Churchill left the comforts of his Harvard professorship and the privileges of his Massachusetts General practice for the North African and later Mediterranean theaters of war, serving as a surgical consultant with the rank of lieutenant colonel. During his time in uniform, he was a major figure in the medical and bureaucratic struggle to increase the use of whole blood on the front lines. Plasma could be transported much more easily than whole blood, but while it increased blood pressure, it lacked the oxygenating properties of red blood cells, As such, plasma was a stopgap measure at best. Whole blood transfusions saved more lives, but demanded a complex system entailing the collection, transportation, and storage of refrigerated blood. Churchill and others led the charge to force recalcitrant army and navy brass to undertake the changeover—despite the daunting logistical challenges. On Aug. 27, 1943, The New York Times ran an article headlined “Live-Blood Banks Save Soldiers’ Lives in Sicily When Plasma Proves Inadequate.” Datelined Allied Headquarters in North Africa, the article reported on the program’s unqualified success in the recently concluded Tunisian campaign. As such, Churchill hoped the article would convince others—from political leaders to regular folk—of the need to expand the use of whole blood in surgical units and military hospitals. “There is need for whole blood transfusions in the treatment of a significant proportion of wounded,” The Times quoted Churchill. “Plasma is not an adequate substitute in these cases.” Donors were sought among “noncombatant troops, convalescent and mildly wounded patients and solders from medical detachments.” The article also noted that the British had used volunteer POWs, paying them $10 for each donation. The successful use of whole blood in North Africa led to its expansion during the Allied slog up the craggy Italian Peninsula (known as the “Forgotten War.”). “We got the blood from the troops in the rear areas,” Churchill recalled after returning stateside in January 1945, adding that “in two or three months after we started at the beginning of 1944 we had delivered nine tons of whole blood for use in the Italian campaign.” Interviewed by the Boston Globe newspaper, Churchill also touted the pioneering work done in the area of wound management. Successes included the establishment of field hospitals near the front lines to provide “forward surgery” before wounded soldiers were sent further back to undergo additional care. This “two-stage” approach to surgery saved untold lives during the war—and in the countless wars that have followed. After the war Churchill remained an influential figure in American medicine, serving as chief of surgical services for Massachusetts General until 1962, and holding the John Homans professorship of surgery at Harvard for 31 years. Edward Delos Churchill passed away in 1972 at the age of 76, near his summer home in Strafford, Vt. Although Churchill—through his long and productive affiliations with Boston General and Harvard—was the epitome of the East Coast professional elite, he never forgot his Corn Belt roots. “People back home think those who go to other areas of the world and become surrounded by the busy affairs of a different life forget their childhood,” Churchill said in his later years. “But there are no more vivid memories.”",

    "content": "Although nearly forgotten today, Bloomington-born artist Sid Smith was a towering figure in American popular culture. From 1917 until his untimely death in 1935, Smith’s newspaper comic strip “The Gumps” was a cultural touchstone, read by millions each day from coast to coast. Robert Sidney “Sid” Smith was born February 13, 1877, in Bloomington. His father, Thomas H. Smith, was one of the city’s earliest and most successful dentists. He was also a lumberman, operating a sawmill outside the city limits. Smith lacked his father’s academic and entrepreneurial drive, and when he was around 12 years old (or so the story goes) his teacher gave him the following advice: “You go home young man. You’re not fit for anything but a cartoonist.” Smith, as he recounted years later, felt “morally insulted” because he had no idea what a cartoonist was. Apparently, Sid Smith attended but never graduated from Bloomington High School “My father wanted me to be a dentist,” he recalled. “But to be a dentist I had to study, and school and I never agreed: they didn’t teach drawing where I went. I was about 17, I think, when I saw a schoolroom for the last time.” Smith’s artistic talent, though, was never in question, and soon he found a local audience for his drawings. When he was 18 or so he began contributing sketches and cartoons to The Sunday Eye, an illustrated weekly newspaper published in Bloomington. “From the start I was crazy to draw pictures and see how they would look reproduced in the newspapers,” he remembered. Failing to land a full-time position he became an itinerant “chalk talker.” He would travel from town to town, entertaining audiences with light chat and whimsical sketches. When money was short, he would hop a freight train to the next town. “My only equipment was chalk, a blackboard, and nerve—chiefly nerve, no money,” he said of his year-long, cross-country tour. “I saw life in a thousand aspects that have been of help to me since.” Smith then bounced from one newspaper to another in places like Indianapolis and Pittsburgh before settling down in Chicago, first with the Examiner and then, in 1911, the Tribune. Smith enjoyed success with “Old Doc Yak,” a Sunday-only strip that celebrated the gentle misadventures of the goat-headed “Doc Yak” (see accompanying two panels). In 1917, Smith unveiled “The Gumps,” a strip featuring the chinless patriarch Andy, his wife Minerva (or “Min”), their son Chester, and a cast of lovingly rendered supporting characters, ranging from Tilda the maid to wealthy Uncle Bim. “The Gumps” was said to be the first major strip to move away from the “joke-a-day” format toward one with a narrative flow. “You don’t draw cartoons, you write ’em,” Smith would say. Guided by Tribune publisher and coeditor Joseph Medill Patterson, Smith fashioned a comedic soap opera of domestic life carried by storylines that stretched for weeks. It was a revolutionary advance in the comic strip medium that would prove wildly popular with the reading public. Andy Gump represented “a kind of everyday philosopher,” Smith once said. “He tries to voice the sentiments of everyday people. My idea is to make him the sort of chap so that people can hold a mirror in front of themselves and say truthfully: ‘There’s Andy Gump.’” In the spring of 1922, Smith signed a $1 million contract—$100,000 for 10 years guaranteed—with the Tribune. As a bonus he received a Rolls-Royce (he also lobbied for, and eventually received, an oriental rug for his office). At the time, the highest paid comic strip artist was Bud Fisher of “Mutt and Jeff” fame, who was paid $50,000 a year. Two months after signing the record contract Smith motored through Bloomington in his Rolls, with The Pantagraph reporting that “the new machine attracted much admiring attention on the streets.” His Smith’s license plate number was “348,” the same as Doc Yak’s and Andy Gump’s. Smith liked to live the high life, and he divided his time between a Gold Coast residence; an estate on the south shore of Lake Geneva, WI; a smaller place he called “Forty Acres” near Genoa City, WI; and a 2,200-acre farm in the northern Illinois community of Shirland. In 1929, Smith killed off supporting character Mary Gold, and this act of artistic fratricide caused such an uproar that the Tribune hired additional help to handle the deluge of mail and phone calls. Eighty years later, this death is regarded as a seminal event in the maturation of the comic strip as a popular art form. Sadly, R. Sidney Smith’s life was cut short when, in the early morning of October 20, 1935, he died in a head-on automobile accident not far from his farm in Shirland. After Smith’s death, Tribune sports cartoonist Gus Edson continued “The Gumps,” and although the strip lasted until 1959, its popularity never reached its earlier heights.",

    "content": "The stain of slavery pervades the American experience, dating well before the nation’s founding to the present. Yet the all-encompassing evil of the “peculiar institution” can also numb us to the realization that those enslaved were fully formed individuals deserving the soul-affirming dignity to tell their own stories. Glimpses of those stories are available to us right here in Central Illinois, well north of the Mason-Dixon line. Fugitives of slavery during the Civil War and enslaved persons liberated by the Union Army made their way here in search of freedom. And after the Civil War, some freed people left the former Confederacy and headed north, hoping to make new lives in Bloomington-Normal and elsewhere. There are several dozen, and likely many more, formerly enslaved persons buried in McLean County and other nearby communities, including Clinton, Delavan, Gibson City and Pontiac. Because many enslaved persons never knew their birth date, there was often guesswork when it came to one’s own biography. Anna Jackson, for instance, passed away in Normal on Feb. 7, 1881, with her age listed as a highly improbable 112. She was born in South Carolina, and her enslaver’s surname was Raab. When Jackson was around ten years old, she was sent to live with Raab’s daughter, who had married a man named Jenkins. Anna Jackson herself then married a man enslaved at the Jenkins' place, and they had ten children, all of whom were “sold off.” Through torturous circumstances, the couple was split apart but both eventually gained their freedom and were reunited—having discarded their enslaver’s name in favor of Jackson. They made their way to Normal, though life was still one of privation. Her husband died at the McLean County Poor Farm in 1862. “They were poverty-stricken,” noted The Pantagraph. “She labored on the washboard for support, and in the spring of 1865 she sent to Missouri for her daughter, Mary, who had ever since cared for the old lady.” We hope that Anna Jackson found some solace in the quiet cadences and pleasing patterns of quilting, for she was recognized as one of the most accomplished quilters in the Twin Cities. In fact, she was still actively piecing quilts not long before her death. The pauper’s cemetery on the former grounds of the McLean County Poor Farm serves as the final resting place for an undetermined number of formerly enslaved individuals. Located about five miles south of downtown Bloomington, the county’s poor farm served as a home for indigent residents, transients, the elderly, the mentally ill and other wards of the county. On May 28, 1911, William Jones died at the Poor Farm and was laid to rest at its “potter’s field.” He was born enslaved in 1810 in Virginia, and had lived in Bloomington for fifty some years before becoming a Poor Farm “inmate” (as residents were called) five months before his death. Several formerly enslaved individuals buried in McLean County were Civil War veterans, having enlisted in the Union Army once they gained their freedom. Isaac Esque, enslaved in Louisiana, shook off the chains of bondage and enlisted in the 65th Regiment, U.S. Colored Infantry. Several weeks after the war’s end, Ike (as he was known) opened a barbershop on East Beaufort Street in Normal, said to be the town’s first such establishment. He continued barbering at that place for eighteen years before moving his business to Bloomington, where he cut hair for another ten years. He was also known as one of the toughest checkers players to beat in the area. In his later years Esque tended a small “truck patch” on the northern edge of Normal, and local residents became accustomed to him hauling produce in and about town aboard a spring wagon pulled by his beloved mule. He was an active member of the local post of the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), an influential fraternal society of Union veterans in the post-Civil War era. “He is regular, attentive and one of the leading spirits of the Normal organization,” noted The Pantagraph some six years before Esque’s death. “When one considers his start in life, the hardships and privations he endured, it is remarkable what he has accomplished—for he owns his home and is proud of the fact.” As Esque’s health declined, Normal’s Civil War veterans cared for one of their own. “Comrades from the Charles E. Hovey Post, GAR, looked after him to a great extent, with the help of kind friends,” it was said. This gesture of brotherhood among former brothers-in-arms, black and white, stands in stark contrast to the nation’s moral abdication when it came to integrating the military, which didn’t happen until after World War II. It should be further noted that the GAR in this area welcomed black veterans, but when the American Legion first organized after World War I, there were racially segregated posts in the Twin Cities. Isaac Esque passed away on Aug. 28, 1920, though it’s not known where he was laid to rest. Lexington Cemetery, located on the small community’s western edge, is the final resting place for two formerly enslaved individuals who served in the Union Army—Daniel Smith (see accompanying photograph) and Jack Turner. In the case of the latter veteran, there is precious little available documentation. It’s said Turner was born in 1820, escaped his enslaver during the Civil War and joined the Union Army. He lived in a humble abode on the outskirts of Lexington in a timbered tract west of what’s today the Amtrak / Union Pacific rail line. His marker reads: Jack Turner, Colored, 1820—April 7, 1903. Simon B. Malone is buried in the Civil War soldier’s plot of the “old city” section of what’s today Evergreen Memorial Cemetery. He was born into slavery in 1842 in Tippah County, Miss., near the Tennessee border. He was 20 years old when, with the arrival of the 5th Regiment, Ohio Cavalry, he liberated himself, and eventually enlisting in Co. D of the 13th Regiment, United States Colored Heavy Artillery. In 1867, two years after the war, he married Julia E. Dillon and the two settled in Normal. Malone held various jobs in the Twin Cities, including teamster and Town of Normal poundmaster—the latter a position involving the care and feeding of stray livestock (and in this instance, perhaps dogs as well.) Malone built a two-story, wood-frame house on the 500 block of Kingsley Street. Sadly, the Malone house was lost to arson on Oct. 15, 1981. The following year, the Town of Normal erected a Humans Relations Commission marker at the site to commemorate the first house in Normal built by an African American. The fate of that marker, which no longer stands, is unknown.",

    "content": "Along Illinois Route 165 between the rural communities of Cooksville and Colfax in eastern McLean County is a long-abandoned, impeccably weathered farmhouse, old and forlorn but still standing strong, a testament to the craftsmanship, know-how, muscle and sweat of a century and a half past. This lone sentinel from a lost age is a near-perfect example of an I-house, an architectural style once popular around these parts in the 19th century. The term I-house comes from Louisiana State University cultural geographer Fred B. Kniffen, who coined the term in 1936. Kniffen noticed the prevalence of this house type in rural Indiana, Illinois and Iowa (states beginning with the letter “I,” hence “I-house”), as well as how builders from those areas carried the layout and design into Louisiana. The I-house style goes back to 17th century England, if not earlier and elsewhere, and spread to the United States and the Southern and Middle-Atlantic regions before moving northward into states carved out of the Northwest Territory (today’s Midwest). The I-house is considered a vernacular architectural style, seeing as it’s defined by the use of common materials and forms with little ornamentation. These homes were built through shared multigenerational knowledge carried by families and communities, and not with the benefit of commercial catalogues, pattern books or some architect’s blueprints. Kniffen, the LSU geographer, championed the idea of folk architecture, and so emphasized the folk knowledge embedded in this vernacular yet eminently functional style of farmhouse. Much like folktales themselves, the basic configuration of the I-house remained unchanged over time and space, though geographical variations developed as it spread to new areas. I-houses can also assume elements from a wide-range of more formal architectural styles, from Greek Revival to Queen Anne, and they were sometimes made of stone or brick, though more often than not they were wood framed. Although the I-house is a generalized form with much variation, generally speaking it features gables to the side and the easily recognizable—plain, yet aesthetically satisfying—symmetrical layout, measuring at least two rooms in length, one room deep and two stories high. The standard I-House came to have a central doorway and hallway, with three to five windows along the second story front. The fact that I-houses were usually one room deep allowed for maximum ventilation and natural light. The chimney or chimneys were usually located at one or both of the gable ends. McLean County was once home to hundreds of I-houses, many built by successful farmers settling here from states such as Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia, as well as the southern tiers of Illinois, Indiana and Ohio. I-houses commonly feature one or more rear or (less frequently) side additions one or 1½ story high. These wings, or “ells,” normally housed the kitchen and perhaps a loft for hired help or children. Such additions give the rectangular footprint more of an “L” or “T” shape. Professor Kniffen and folklorist Henry Glassie also showed how the I-house symbolized economic mobility and success on the emerging Corn Belt, a move away from the frontier world of rough-hewn logs to a more civilized one of wood framing. This sequence is exemplified in the life and times of Isaac Funk, the Illinois “cattle king” and patriarch of a family line that would come to play an oversized role in McLean County’s development. Today, at the Funks Grove Rest Area on Interstate 55 south of Bloomington, there’s a marker at the spot where, in 1824, he erected his first permanent home—a log cabin. Some twenty years later, Funk built an I-house at the same location as the cabin (both were lost to fire.) This I-house featured paired doors, one for each of the first floor’s two rooms, a layout that was popular at the time. “American farmers were slow to adopt the central hallway which fashionable design dictated; they seem to have regarded it as a waste of space and an impediment to ventilation,” noted Illinois State University historical geographer William D. Walters in his 1997 study of corn farming in McLean County. “By 1850, central hall and single doors had become the rule in McLean County I-houses.” The Funk I-house is gone, but there are two others in McLean County still here and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Hubbard House in Hudson received such recognition in 1979. The rear (or east) wing dates to 1857 and first served as the home for early town physician Silas Hubbard and his wife Juliana . In 1872, the growing Hubbard family added an I-house to face Broadway Street, Hudson’s main north-south thoroughfare. According to daughter Mary Hubbard, her mother Juliana conceived and directed the plan for the two-story addition. A decade ago, the Hubbard House, which is a private, single-family residence, underwent extensively remodeling. The other I-house in question, this one in the northern McLean County community of Chenoa, is open to the public. The Matthew T. Scott House, located on First Avenue a few block north of Chenoa’s old business district, was, like Hubbard’s, built in two stages. In 1855, Scott, a landowner and “prairie capitalist,” built the 1½, three-room cottage that now serves as the rear wing. He then added an attached I-house in 1863. Interestingly, while it’s common for I-houses to include wings which were added later on, with both the Hubbard and Scott homes, the “ell” is the original part of the structure and the I-house represents the later addition. And unlike the Funk-I house and its paired doors, both the Hubbard and Scott homes feature central doorways. The Scott I-house also carries Georgian influences, most prominently with the pediment above the second story. This handsome, historic residence earned a spot on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Closed for the season, the home, maintained by the Matthew T. Scott House Foundation, reopens in April. Although the cruelties and vagaries of time, the prairie winds and humankind have depleted their ranks, there are still a good number of I-houses scattered about rural McLean County and beyond—and many in surprisingly good shape.

    "content": "Although the COVID-19 pandemic has forced the McLean County Museum of History to temporarily close its doors to the public, the Library/Archives staff remains as engaged as ever—shutdown or not. One thing that has kept us busy is accepting and processing donations from folks like you. As a not-for-profit institution, the museum is dependent on donations to enlarge its historically invaluable collections of objects, papers, and other items to ensure that the stories of the past remain alive both for us today, and for those who follow tomorrow. We take what we do here seriously, because preserving the past for future generations is serious business. The museum has received many fascinating donations these past several months, including one by former local resident Sandra Brenneman Oldendorf, who now calls Bozeman, Mont. home. Her rich and varied donation included letters she received from Richard Mehl during the Vietnam War. Mehl, a U.S. Marine at the time, was a Stanford High School classmate of Sandra’s. She also donated documents from the founding and early years of the local chapter of the National Organization for Women, of which she played a role, as well as various items, dating to 1972 and 1973, from the Girl Scout’s Camp Peairs on shores of Lake Bloomington. Sandra also gifted to the museum a range of material that speaks to her family’s deep connections to this area—such as a handwritten family genealogy record book kept by Otto J. Brenneman, Sandra’s great-grandfather who passed away in 1934. Also included were two journals—covering the years 1916 to 1921—kept by Otto’s daughter, Elsie Brenneman, who was born in 1899 and came of age on the family farm in western McLean County, along the Tazewell County line. Brenneman’s journals offer a window into life on a Central Illinois farm, as experienced by an intelligent young woman. Sometimes, though, the triumphs and tragedies of the wider world intruded onto this quiet corner of the Corn Belt. “This morn at 6 o’clock we got word that Germany has signed the Armistice. How wonderful,” a 19-year-old Brenneman noted on Nov. 11, 1918. Although she wrote mostly in blue/black ink in her journal, the entry marking the end of the First World War was penned in red. “I took the flag up on the windmill tower,” she continued. “This eve Victor, Nora [two of her siblings], & I went to a big celebration at Minier. One big ‘hallebalu’” (that last word is a creative misspelling of “hullaballoo!”) Brenneman went on to earn a bachelor’s degree in business education from Illinois State Normal University, and a master’s from Northwestern University. For 33 years—from 1927 to 1960—she was an indispensable figure on the Illinois State campus, serving first as the school’s registrar and then as director of admissions. She also took an active interest in local community affairs. It was as a member of the Bloomington Business and Professional Women’s Club that she helped escort Amelia Earhart around town during the famed aviator’s April 6-7, 1936, visit to the Twin Cities. This appearance included an overnight stay at the Illinois Hotel (now the Illinois House) in downtown Bloomington. Earhart’s was here by invitation of the Women’s Club to deliver a talk, “Aviation Adventures,” at the old Bloomington Coliseum. Brenneman, it was said, served as “general chairman for the undertaking.” The story of the ill-starred pilot’s two visits to the Twin Cities (the other was a refueling stopover in 1931) is one that the McLean County Museum of History has told before. But thanks to Sandra Brenneman Oldendorf’s donation, we now have more of the story to tell! The Earhart-related items in her donation include a thumbnail photograph of Earhart and Brenneman; a circular announcing the Coliseum talk; and an 8x10 studio portrait sent to Brenneman, perhaps as a token of thanks for being a gracious host. There were also clipped and photocopied newspaper articles relating to Earhart’s visit to Bloomington and her subsequent disappearance over the Pacific Ocean. “I was her guest for breakfast in [the] Illinois Hotel,” Brenneman noted in a handwritten annotation alongside one article. During her talk at the Bloomington Coliseum, Earhart explained how she conquered her fears before embarking on one or another of her many record-setting flights into the wild blue yonder. “I have my own philosophy of worry,” she explained. “All worry must be finished two months before an expedition sets off. If the goal is not worth it, give up the plan, but never worry. Hamlet would have made a poor pilot, because he was such a worrier.” By the spring of 1936, there was already much buzz regarding Earhart’s intentions to circumnavigate the globe. “The announcement that I am to make a flight around the world in June is erroneous,” she told The Pantagraph. “I am booked for lectures until May 1st, and one doesn’t plan a world trip in 30 days.” Yet such a flight she did attempt—and in little more than a year’s time. On June 1, 1937, Earhart and crewmember Fred Noonan took off on their globe-spanning journey. One month and one day later, July 2, the two pilots and their plane were lost in the vastness of the Central Pacific. Their disappearance remains one of the great mysteries of the 20th century. Brenneman’s life, on the other hand, remained decidedly more grounded—figuratively and literally! She was active not only in the Business and Professional Women’s Club (even serving as its president), but the Unitarian Church and the Brokaw Hospital Service League. A “devotee of golf, bridge and cooking,” she passed away on Aug. 1, 1974, at the age of 74. And thanks to her great-niece’s donation, Elsie Brenneman’s memory lives on in the archives of the McLean County Museum of History.",

    "content": "On August 26, 1920, U.S. Secretary of State Bainbridge Colby signed into law the 19th Amendment granting women the right to vote. The intentionally muted signing ceremony—held at Colby’s personal residence no less—marked the end of an arduous journey toward women’s suffrage dating to the anti-slavery movement in the decades before the Civil War. Bloomington was never a hotbed of suffragist sentiment, yet beginning in the early 1870s and through the next half century there existed on the local scene measured support for the enfranchisement of women. From time to time, Bloomington hosted lectures, debates, organizational meetings and conventions, all relating to suffrage. Furthermore, the pages of The Pantagraph and the city’s other newspapers were occasionally peppered with lively exchanges between those who supported and those who opposed (with men and women on both sides) the right of the “fairer sex” to vote. Illinois’ statehood constitution of 1818 limited voting to “white male inhabitants,” and the state’s third constitution (ratified in 1870) enlarged the franchise to include African-American males, though calls to expand that fundamental right to women fell on deaf ears. In March of that year, 1870, suffrage titan Susan B. Anthony debated Illinois State Normal University Professor Edwin C. Hewett before a packed crowd at Schroeder’s Opera House in downtown Bloomington. Almost two years later, February 1872, the Illinois Woman Suffrage Association held its convention at the same location. The statewide group’s executive committee featured three women from Bloomington—Barbara Prince, Jane Fell and Frances Hogg. Out-of-state speakers at this meeting included Mary Adelle Hazlett, the “little wolverine” from Michigan, and Susan Anthony, back once more and still tirelessly fighting the good fight. “She speaks like lightning and cuts and slashes in every direction,” The Pantagraph said of Anthony. Dr. Ellen B. Ferguson, a Bloomington physician and proto-feminist, inveighed against the principle of taxation without representation. She also spent part of her half hour speech denouncing the “frivolity of fashionable life.” Ferguson told the gathered suffragists that girls are “educated too much in the direction of finery and feathers and not enough in the direction of useful information and the knowledge of how to take care of themselves.” Preaching self-sufficiency, she said that many local girls could “grow up to be magnificent specimens of womanhood if they were to leave the realm of fashion.” By 1873, the Illinois legislature OK’d women to hold elected offices relating to public education, though they were still prevented from voting in these or any other races. Even so, by the following year Illinois could boast of having 10 female county school superintendents elected by male voters. Finally, in 1891, the Illinois General Assembly granted women the right to vote in school elections. As a result, the Monday, April 4, 1892, election of two Bloomington Board of Education members (though both male) marked the first time women could vote in the city. For its part, The Pantagraph called this historic event the “most remarkable, interesting, and in many respects exciting, election which has ever occurred in Bloomington.” With early morning rains threatening voter turnout, Mary Ward, “clad in gossamer and galoshes and holding a dripping umbrella,” became the first woman to cast a vote in a Bloomington election. By the time the weather improved, the line of first-time voters extended out the County Courthouse (where the segregated-by-sex ballot boxes were located) and down Main Street. “None of the lady voters yesterday smoked, chewed tobacco or drank whiskey while waiting in line,” The Pantagraph joked. “No wonder some people don’t want women to vote.” Women comprised nearly one-quarter of the electorate that day. “The gentle sex descended on that single ballot box like an avalanche,” concluded The Pantagraph. At long last, the landmark Illinois Municipal Voting Act of 1913 gave women the right to cast ballots in all elections not specifically referenced in the state constitution. This meant that Illinois was the first state east of the Mississippi River to allow women to vote in presidential contests. And on June 10, 1919, Illinois became the first state (beating Wisconsin by an hour) to ratify the 19th Amendment, which would end all remaining state roadblocks to full voting rights. In 1923, Lottie Holman O’Neill of the DuPage County community of Downers Grove became the first woman to serve in the Illinois House of Representatives, and two years later, Florence Fifer Bohrer (see accompanying image), a fellow Republican from Bloomington, became the first woman to occupy a seat in the state senate.",

    "content": "In the years before the Civil War and for several decades afterward, Bloomington’s African-American community embraced alternatives to the Fourth of July holiday. After all, the triumphant narrative of Independence Day rang hollow to many Black Americans when there were still some 4 million of their brothers and sisters in bondage. And even after the war’s end African Americans preferred to celebrate their independence on days reserved for the singular trials and travails, and hopes and ambitions, of their people. The biggest African-American holiday in this period was known as First of August, or more generally Emancipation Day, and the all-day affair usually included a procession, afternoon picnic, speeches on the state of Black America, and an evening of music and dancing. The First of August holiday commemorated the anniversary when slaves were freed in the British West Indies, Aug.1, 1834 From available evidence, the first such Emancipation Day was held in Bloomington on Aug. 1, 1859. This gathering also doubled as a fundraiser for the local African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church building fund and Sunday school (this church is Wayman AME today). Tickets were 25 cents, with discounts for families, and could be purchased at Hiram Underhill’s barbershop across from the American House, a hotel on Front Street. Underhill was African-American, as were most barbers in 19th century Bloomington. On this summer day in 1859, a procession, likely including the better portion of Bloomington-Normal’s African-American community and a good number of Black folk from nearby towns and cities, assembled at the new AME church on North Center Street and paraded to Major’s Grove, a wooded, park-like spot on the north end of the city. Nineteen-year-old Edward Joiner, born free in Illinois and barbering for Underhill at the time, made what was said to be his debut as a public orator. Joiner, a future minister (he was licensed to preach in the AME church around this time), “exhorted his brethren to put their own shoulders to the wheel, and improve themselves in knowledge and dignity of character, as an essential means to realizing their aspirations.” The speaker following Joiner, identified by The Pantagraph as a “stranger from Chicago,” noted the day’s significance as the anniversary of slavery’s abolition in the West Indies. The First of August celebration of 1862 offered “more than the usual spirit and interest,” occurring as it did in the midst of the Civil War. A former slave identified as E. Hutchens gave the afternoon’s first address. “His style of speaking was plain, forcible, and correct, sometimes bordering on eloquence, but never approaching highfalutin,” remarked The Pantagraph. “He gave a glimpse of slave life, and dwelt at length upon the duty of his brethren in the free states, to educate their children, elevate their moral and religious character, and fit them for the higher position which he dared to hope they would soon be allowed to enjoy.” After 1870, Emancipation Day was often held at different times of the year. New Year’s Day became a favorite date for two reasons. On Jan. 1, 1808, the federal government banned the importation of slaves into the United States, the earliest day permitted by the Constitution. And Jan. 1, 1863, marked the effective date of Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation, which freed slaves in parts of the Confederacy still under rebellion. Sept. 22 also a popular date to hold Emancipation Day, for on that day in 1863 Lincoln first issued his Proclamation. Other Central Illinois communities, including Clinton, Decatur and Pontiac, held their own Emancipation Day programs (whether annually or occasionally), and when possible a party of Bloomington residents, sometimes numbering 50 or more, would make the trip as a show of solidarity and friendship. On Jan. 1, 1875, in what was described as the “grandest demonstration ever made by the colored citizens of the city of Bloomington,” Emancipation Day festivities began with a procession from the African-American Baptist church on Lee Street (this church is now Mt. Pisgah on West Market Street) to Phoenix Hall on the south side of the courthouse square. A second emancipation celebration was held later that year, on Aug. 11, and it included a program and picnic at the old west side fairgrounds. The day-long event, reported The Pantagraph, “was quite well attended and highly enjoyed by our colored brethren of Bloomington and neighboring towns, and also by a number of white persons.” Currently on display at the Atlanta (Ill.) Museum 20 miles south of Bloomington is a poster-size announcement for a Sept. 22, 1875 celebration marking the 12th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation (see accompanying image). The gathering, which included Benjamin Franklin Rogers’ Brass Band of Springfield and a “grand, old-style barbecue,” was held on the Union Agricultural Society grounds outside of Atlanta. Emancipation Day remained popular throughout the 19th century. In the summer of 1894, for instance, Bloomington’s Miller Park was the site of a large celebration. Swelling the crowd were African-American delegations from Decatur, Jacksonville, Lincoln, Peoria, Springfield and elsewhere. There were sporadic emancipation celebrations in Bloomington as late as the mid-1950s, though by that time they had taken the form of a picnic for African-American children. Today, the heir to Emancipation Day is Juneteenth. Sometimes known as Freedom Day, Juneteenth commemorates the announcement, made on Jun. 19, 1865, abolishing slavery in Texas. On Jan. 1, 1884, the Rev. C.S. Smith of Bloomington’s AME Church delivered a fiery Emancipation Day address at Central Music Hall in Chicago. Less than two decades after the Civil War, the promises of emancipation and reconstruction had, in the face of violence and intimidation, given way to white-only rule, disenfranchisement and segregation. And what of colored soldiers of the late rebellion, those who “lifted the Stars and Stripes from the dust of treason, and planted [it] on liberty’s universal throne?” asked Rev. Smith. “In times of war they fought to defend and protect the nation’s life, and in times of peace it is the duty of the nation to defend and protect them,” he replied, boldly asserting that a government “powerless to maintain the liberty of its citizens … ought to perish beyond the memory of God and man.” Smith was uncompromising in his condemnation of the American South and a federal government complicit in denying African Americans basic political and civil rights. “I care nothing about the so-called rights of the states,” he concluded, “when my liberty is jeopardized and my constitutional privileges trampled on and denied.’",

    "content": "Farm silos, an iconic symbol of the Corn Belt, have long flummoxed city and suburban folk. Frustrated parents clueless as to the purpose of these \"farmer towers\" often tell their children that they hold water or shelled corn for livestock. Or more imaginative mothers and fathers have been known to describe them as specially designed barns for giraffes. And one wonders how many adolescent boys over these many years have found the silo’s phallic shape an inexhaustible source of sophomoric wisecracking is anyone’s guess. Children’s stories and teenage guffaws aside, silos were built to hold fermented livestock feed known as ensilage, or silage. One of the great and venerable problems in animal husbandry was the difficulty of storing, or “carrying over,” enough fodder from the growing season into the long winter months. In the late 19th century, hay was mostly stored loose, so even the more cavernous hay mows in the largest barns could only support a limited number of stock. Silos, on the other hand, are designed to hold densely packed, nutritious fodder, and in doing so give the farmer the ability to house, feed, breed and sell many more animals than possible with cut and dried grasses. Silage is created when corn, legumes and other \"green fodder,\" such as alfalfa, clover and soybeans, are finely chopped and blown into the silo. Corn silage, for instance, includes the entire ear—kernels, cob, husk and all (and, if necessary, even the stalks). The silage “pile” is then tightly compressed and covered, meaning that although the feed retains moisture, the lack of oxygen slows decay and spoilage. If properly packed and stored, silage can last several seasons or more. Although “low-oxygen” silos are often associated with dairy farming, in McLean County and this stretch of the Corn Belt, they were often used for beef cattle and general purpose grain farming as well. The first round silos to gain widespread popularity were constructed of wood, usually with vertical planking (or staves) fitted tightly together. The staves were then reinforced with steel hoops (image something looking like an oversized barrel). In the late 1870s, Dr. Manly Miles of the University of Illinois played an instrumental role encouraging silo construction and the use of silage as livestock feed. In 1886, C.M. Payne of Normal had erected what’s believed to be one of the first—if not the first—tower silos in the area. The following year Levi and Isaiah Dillon purchased Payne’s silo for use in their trans-Atlantic business importing French draft horses (called Normans back then and Percherons today). “Whether farmers generally will adopt the system or not is a question,” The Pantagraph noted in 1887 of silos and silage. “It is a new idea in this vicinity and farmers are conservative people.” Some of the misconceptions held by farmers involving silage included the belief that the feed would lead to more difficult calving, or that the quality of milk would suffer. Neither proved true. It’s likely the C.M. Payne silo was made of wood, though manufacturers and farmers were already beginning to experiment with other building materials. Wood silos, though relatively cheap and easy to construct, could be troublesome. It was difficult to make the walls airtight, and in addition to losses from rot and spoilage, wood silos were also fire hazard and, when empty, tended to topple over in heavy winds. By the first two decades of the 20th century, most silos were being constructed of far more durable materials. Brick and drain tile manufacturers, for example, were finding a new market for both their fired brick and glazed hollow tile. Another breakthrough came with quality concrete in the form of Portland cement. The most popular style of cement silo borrowed a similar construction method from wood stave towers. Grooves along the edge bound the cement staves together, making for a formidable shell. And much like wood silos, steel hoops or wire served to reinforce the entire structure. Silos were a topic of great interest at the December 1909 gathering of the McLean County Farmers’ Institute. Lyle Johnston, institute president, told the gathering that he had yet to encounter a farmer who, once having tested silage on beef cattle, chose to abandon the practice. For a brief period beginning in 1912, the Illinois Silo Company manufactured wood silos at the south end of Bloomington, between Lincoln and Lafayette streets (roughly where Behr Iron and Metal is located today). This factory manufactured wood stave silos, and had its own Illinois Traction System rail spur and loading platform. The company had ambitious plans to manufacture some 1,000 to 1,500 silos for the 1912 season, and as such had ordered some one million board feet of fir and redwood lumber from the Pacific Coast. There were other silo manufacturers in the area, including John Wilcox & Sons in McLean, which manufactured high-grade building brick and clay drain tile before expanding its product line to include curved silo brick. By the 1940s, thermos-like silos constructed of fiberglass bonded to curved sheets of steel, which appeared under the brand name Harvestore, came onto the market. These truly airtight structures allow for atmospheric change by way of bag inside the top of silo, which inflates or deflates as needed to maintain equalized pressure. Harvestores also featured augers to unload silage from the bottom. Such automatic unloaders, noted Loran Berg in a study of silos, “replaced the chore of the daily climb into the silo to pitch silage down to the ground below.” Manufactured by the A.O. Smith Corp. of Beloit, Wis., one of the first Harvestore units in the area was erected in the fall of 1949 on the G.H. and Lowell Dueringer farm in the Ford County community of Melvin. Today, many dairy and beef operators make use of bag silos. These are tubes of triple-layer plastic sheeting, ranging eight to twelve feet in diameter and as long as 200 feet, which are laid length-wise on the ground near pasture or feed lot. Bag silos are extremely cost efficient, but lack the durability and presence of the old tower silos, which mostly stand empty, reminders of a bygone era.",

    "content": "As with most small town movie houses, the Colonial Theatre in Colfax offered area residents more than a parade of Hollywood legends on the silver screen. For much of the 20th century, the Colonial, located on the 100 block of West Main Street in downtown Colfax, also hosted stage plays, music concerts, public meetings, holiday gatherings, patriotic remembrances and school activities. The Colonial Theatre was the undertaking of Colfax businessman A.H. Arnold. Situated 25 miles northeast of Bloomington, the Village of Colfax was of sufficient size and distance from larger communities to support a small theater of its own. Construction began in the summer of 1917, and took—from start to finish—only 90 days. The practical yet attractive masonry facade of Hytex brick and limestone trim (see accompanying photograph) remains mostly unchanged more than a century after the theater’s completion. The 40 by 80 feet auditorium offered an initial seating capacity of 500. The original dark forest green seats came from the A.H. Andrews Co. of Chicago, while interior decorations were handled by Springfield-based G.H. Schanbacher & Son. And in order to show movies, Arnold purchased and saw to the installation of a Motiograph “picture machine.” The theater opened on Monday, Nov. 5, 1917. The inaugural program included a touring Redpath Chautauqua lecture and music by Bloomington’s Goforth Orchestra. Tickets were $1, or the equivalent of more than $21 today, adjusted for inflation. Following the grand opening, the Colonial’s second and third programs were stage plays. Matinee and evening performances of the Robert Sherman production “A Good for Nothing Husband,” described as a “screamingly funny comedy-drama,” were held Nov. 10. Goforth’s Orchestra returned to provide the music, with tickets priced at 55 and 83 cents. Gaskell and MacVitty’s “The Other Man’s Wife” followed with an evening performance on Nov. 23. At the time, a theater in a community such as Colfax made economic sense. Getting to the “big city” of Bloomington for shopping or entertainment was often no easy matter. A 1923 map of Central Illinois, for instance, shows no “hard roads” (that is, those that were paved) reaching Colfax. The only railroad serving the village, the Illinois Central’s “Bloomer Line,” was often the easiest way to travel to Bloomington or elsewhere. When the theater opened, Colfax’s population was around 970 (today’s it’s a little more than 1,000). The theater also drew residents from nearby Anchor and Cooksville, two tiny communities considerably smaller than Colfax. Farmers and others outside these towns also flocked to the Colonial, this at a time when the countryside was considerably more populated than it is today. Other similarly sized communities had long-operating theaters with rich histories of their own. The Scenic in downtown Lexington, to cite but one example, served as that community’s movie house for something like four decades. As motion pictures became increasingly popular, the Colonial Theatre in Colfax evolved into a true movie house. Even so, live entertainment was often mingled into the silver screen programming. The silent film comedy “Away Goes Prudence” with Billie Burke played at the Colonial Aug. 5, 1920. Prior to the 7:30 and 9:00 p.m. shows, local resident Madeline Mayes entertained moviegoers on the accordion. During the golden era of radio, musicians from the WLS National Barn Dance show occasionally performed at the Colonial. On May 5, 1928, it was Guy and Kathryn Pulley, “playing banjos, Hawaiian guitars and ukuleles as only a few are able to play them.” And the Barn Dance’s “Pie Plant Pete” (a.k.a. Claud J. Moye) appeared in person on April 22, 1931, followed by the “all-talking” western “Fair Warning” with George O’Brien. The Colonial was often repurposed for hastily organized public meetings. In November 1943, during World War II, the theater hosted one of the War Manpower Commission recruitment drives seeking workers for the massive Aluminum Company of America plant in McCook, Ill. The theater also opened its doors for gatherings and observances, including Armistice Day (now known as Veterans Day), school concerts, graduations, and children’s Christmas parties, among other events. Some longtime Colfax area residents will recall Fred G. Weppler, who owned the Colonial for much of the 1950s and 1960s. The ubiquity of the automobile in post-World War II America doomed the viability of small town movie houses such as the Colonial, as many Colfax merchants found themselves increasingly unable to complete with the bright lights of Bloomington. Weppler closed the Colonial in 1968. Soon thereafter, though, donations from local businessmen helped create a youth foundation, which assumed management of the theater on a not-for-profit basis. By the spring of 1969, movies at the renamed Octavia Theatre ran Saturday and Sunday only, with a 7:15 show time both nights. It was 75 cents for those twelve and older; 50 cents for those younger. The June 1969 schedule included “Rough Night in Jericho,” a “hard-hitting western” featuring Dean Martin and George Peppard; “The Happiest Millionaire,” a Walt Disney production starring Fred MacMurray and Greer Carson; and the cornball, slapstick comedy “Did You Hear the One About the Traveling Saleslady?” with Phyllis Diller and Bob Denver. The youth foundation’s Octavia Theatre project lasted a year or two before Eugene Grosse and family purchased the venerable building. A resident of nearby Anchor, Grosse installed a new sound system, replacing the antiquated setup likely dating to the introduction of “talkies” in the early 1930s. Under Grosse’s management, movies that played at the Colonial (the family restored the old name) included Disney’s “Swiss Family Robinson;” the Barbara Streisand vehicle “Funny Girl;” the classic tearjerker “Love Story” with Ryan O’Neal and Ali MacGraw; and “The Cowboys,” one of John Wayne’s swansong roles and one of a handful of films in which Duke’s character dies on screen. The date of the Colonial Theatre’s final curtain call is not known, but movies were shown there as late as November 1972. Today, the old theater building serves as a shop for a local welding business. You can’t catch a movie at the Colonial anymore, but you still can at the Princess Theatre, a 1916 beauty in downtown LeRoy designed by prominent Bloomington architect Arthur L. Pillsbury. Today, the restored Princess, owned and operated by the Michael and Gail Hanafin family, shows recent releases Friday through Sunday. So head out to the Princess this weekend or next! While you’re there, take a moment to remember the Colonial and all the other small town “popcorn palaces,” most now razed or empty and forlorn, that once brought silver screen magic to the Corn Belt.",

    "content": "For the better part of four decades, friends Jacob Welby Bucher and Charles Carroll Fell of Bloomington performed as the popular vaudeville song and dance act, “Welby and Pearl.” From the mid-1870s and into the early 1900s, the two hoofers often performed in blackface with nationally touring minstrel shows. Bucher and Fell, according to one account, left sleepy Bloomington for the bright lights of Chicago in the mid-1870s while still in their teens, fast earning a reputation as first-rate cloggers. “They soon dropped white face and took up minstrelsy, and it was then that they made their greatest hit,” noted a posthumous tribute to the song-and-dance duo. The Fells are one of the more distinguished and prominent families in McLean County history. Charles Carroll Fell’s long minstrel career as “Carroll Pearl” had been all but forgotten until recently, when local historian Rochelle Gridley unearthed this fascinating (and troubling to today’s sensibilities) story of a Bloomington boy in blackface who made good. Pearl’s father, Kersey Fell, was a younger brother to Jesse Fell, one of the founders of Normal and namesake of Illinois State University’s Fell Hall, as well as Fell Avenue and Fort Jesse Road. Kersey, like Jesse, practiced law for a time in Bloomington. And like his brother Jesse, Kersey left his legal practice to make a tidy sum in real estate and land speculation. Kersey married Jane Price and the couple had eight children, five of whom were boys. The Fells were a rather serious lot, all things considered. Born in 1857, Charles Carroll was the exception. “The other boys became staid businessmen but Carroll had a roving streak, and the glamour of the footlights proved irresistible,” noted The Pantagraph upon his death in 1925. After the Civil War and continuing into the 20th century, vaudeville was a wildly popular form of public entertainment. Traveling troupes offered a seemingly endless array of performers and performances—standup comedians and pratfall-laden burlesque; acrobats and jugglers; impersonators; feats of strength; animal acts; and, first and foremost, music—with song and dance numbers center stage. Ethnic humor, much of stereotypical, also defined vaudeville, especially, and most perniciously, minstrelsy. In this nakedly racist form of entertainment, white entertainers blackened their faces and used exaggerated black English to depict American Americans as lazy, childlike and other characteristic grotesqueries. By infantilizing black people, white America could mock—while simultaneously expropriating—black culture. Jacob Welby Bucher and Charles Carroll Fell’s views regarding African Americans, racist or otherwise, are unknown. Although it may be hard to believe today, some blackface entertainers regarded their performances as unconnected to larger issues of race or racism, let alone political or civil rights or larger issues of social justice. And some who “donned the charcoal” even believed they were, in a way, paying homage to black culture and tradition. As one of the longest running acts of the era, Welby and Pearl traveled the length and breadth of the U.S. and beyond many times over, earning a national reputation for their clogging routines with various vaudeville and minstrel companies. From available evidence, the two entertainers began their long career in 1874 or 1875. By September 1876, “Welby and Pearl” were part of a larger troupe that enjoyed a long run at the Coliseum, an arena-like venue located at the corner of State and Washington streets in the heart of downtown Chicago. Shows were nightly, seven days a week, with a matinee on Sunday. “Balcony especially reserved for ladies and their escorts,” read one advertisement. By the following summer of 1877, Welby and Pearl were with Harry Robinson’s Minstrels, a company featuring Robinson’s “burlesque trapeze;” Lem H. Wiley’s Silver Cornet Band; Billy McAllister’s “Dutch comicalities” and “Tyrolean warbling;” Tommy Sadler’s baby elephants; George Robinson’s female impersonations; and the “quintette clog” or “silver statue clog” of Welby and Pearl and three additional hoofers—Sadler, Stiles and Goodyear. In November 1877, The Vicksburg (Mississippi) Herald newspaper reported that Robinson’s “admirable array of Ethiopian talent” (the term Ethiopian was often employed as a synonym for black) performed before the “largest and most generally appreciative” audience ever gathered at the city’s opera house. Yet such was the theater business that hard-earned dollars could be lost as fast as they could be made. By early November 1878, Harry Robinson’s minstrel company was bankrupt and disbanded, so Welby and Pearl were back in Bloomington, reduced to being the beneficiaries of a charity show organized by their friends and associates and staged at downtown’s Durley Hall. Yet such was the business, also, that one was never down and out for good, especially if you were as talented and hardworking as Welby and Pearl. And sure enough, in two months time the pair found themselves back on the road, this time with McAllister’s Minstrels, appearing in the likes of Terre Haute, Ind. and elsewhere. By the turn of the last century, if not earlier, Welby and Pearl were associated with the Gorton’s Minstrels, a popular touring company in which they also had a financial stake. In February 1902, the entertainers passed through Bloomington to visit friends and renew old acquaintances. According to The Pantagraph, the two song and dance men had just wrapped up a 183-week tour with Gorton’s company, which traveled by way of a private railcar with its own wait staff and chef. Welby and Pearl were still appearing with Gorton’s Minstrels as late as 1908, nearly three and a half decades after the two embarked on their joined-at-the-hip stage career. Longevity of this kind in a business as notoriously volatile as theater was rare indeed. And in fact, the two continued to perform together, especially in the Chicago area, until Jacob Welby Bucher’s death from Bright’s disease in 1915. He passed away in Chicago but was buried in Pontiac, home of his brother. Charles Carroll Fell died ten years later in Virginia. “The silvery chords that enthralled thousands during the forty years of his stage career, will be heard no more,” eulogized The Pantagraph. “The curtain has fallen, but in many hearts, the memory of this sweet singer and Adonis of the stage, can never fade.” The curtain has long fallen on minstrelsy, now universally vilified and rejected as a despicable art form. But what has not faded are the hard lessons its popularity tells us about how racism is fundamentally and inextricably intertwined with the story of America—both in Welby and Pearl’s time and in our own.",

    "content": "The story of “Rags” is proof that most everyone loves a shaggy dog story, especially those of the literal kind. From 1907 to 1912, if not longer, Rags, a fiercely independent, free-spirited canine of uncertain pedigree, traveled across Central Illinois on the electric-powered “interurban” passenger cars of the Illinois Traction System. The ITS was a light rail network that connected Bloomington to Peoria, Decatur, Springfield, Champaign and Danville, as well as the St. Louis metropolitan area. Each of these communities also had its own streetcar system, so upon arriving at the city of his choice, Rags would promptly board a local trolley car. “While evidently no more than a common dog in every sense of the word,” commented The Pantagraph, “his intelligence has been recognized and he is watched by streetcar employees as a mother watches her child.” After a day or two riding the local “cars,” he would once more board the interurban and head to the next city, ready to do it all over again. Despite having no owner, Rags was always welcomed by motormen and conductors up and down the line. His was a hobo’s life of riding the rails, unencumbered by a master’s leash or a fenced-in lot. “He could jump on and off moving cars as well as the most proficient trainman,” it was said of Rags. Not surprisingly, he was accorded various honorific titles by the Central Illinois press, including “official line inspector” of the Illinois Traction System. His parentage and age were unknown, though he was said to be water spaniel on his mother’s side and Scottish terrier on his father’s. “He was a brown, rough-coated dog, with hazel eyes and a most affable nature,” went one typical description of Rags. His name came from his unruly shaggy coat, which even when “well-combed, brushed and bathed, refused to be sleek and smooth.” Rags may be gone but he’s not forgotten. Bloomington resident and railroad enthusiast Mike Fortney has devoted two articles to Rags in “The Flyer,” the magazine of the Illinois Traction System. His most recent write-up appeared in the spring 2015 issue. Little is known of Rags, especially when it comes to his pre-peripatetic life. How he came to be the famed traveler was a “matter of much discussion and many wild conclusions.” Consequently, it’s not surprising that there were several wildly divergent “origin stories.” One such account maintained that Rags was adopted by an engine house company of the Springfield Fire Department. After serving “valiantly with the fire laddies,” Rags then “extended his jurisdiction” to Springfield’s streetcars and then the interurban. Other stories as to Rag’s beginnings are less convincing. For instance, there was speculation—“accepted by many and scoffed by others”—that Rags was in fact the reincarnated form of Daddy Rice, a Springfield streetcar motorman. Though Rags didn’t have nine lives to spare, he survived, cat-like, several near-fatal mishaps. In August 1907, aboard a fast-moving interurban near Staunton, he leaned too far out the door and accidently tumbled out and onto the rail bed. Left for dead, Rags reappeared the following day, not far from where he was thrown, none worse for the wear and barking up a storm, as was his custom. This wouldn’t be the last time Rags seemingly returned from the grave. In March 1909, at a siding near Springfield, Rags was caught under the wheels of a passing express. “The trainmen wept openly as they knelt over the small brown body on the track,” reported The Pantagraph. Pronounced dead, Rags was “tenderly laid by the side of the track.” Word quickly spread of his passing across the whole Illinois Traction System. A party was dispatched from Springfield to recover the body for a “first-class” burial, but they couldn’t locate him where he was left. After some searching they found Rags about one mile away hiding under a farmhouse porch, alive but tending to an injured leg. The poor guy had mashed his left hind foot, losing two toes in the process. Carried back to Springfield, Rags, now described as “three and five-eighths legged,” was fitted with a rubber foot. By late June, an impatient Rags, tiring of his long period of convalescence, secreted himself away. “The pitiful stump,” reported the June 25, 1909 Pantagraph, “wasn’t yet healed as much as it might have been but Rags had felt the call of the cars and he simply couldn’t stay away any longer,” reported the June 25, 1909 Pantagraph. In the spring of 1910, Rags served as a main attraction for the fourth annual dog show at the old Bloomington Coliseum, having been brought to this city by Illinois Traction conductor Harry Rugless. “The canine was looking healthy, but not pretty,” The Pantagraph playfully posited. “It is impossible for the dog to look pretty, although he is possessed with a lovable disposition. The three-day show began March 31, and featured 200 dogs, including Roy Bendure’s celebrated bloodhounds. Rags, with his stall immediately to the left of the show’s main entrance, drew more than his share of gawkers. “Rags the interurban traveler,” read a sign at his stall. “He rides because there is no smoke, dust or dirt. Rags likes all, excepting the meat trust.” The “smoke, dust or dirt” was a reference to the clean, smooth ride of electric-powered interurban cars, especially when compared to coal-fired, ash-belching steam locomotives. And “meat trust” was a reference to the monopoly-like power of the leading meatpackers of the day, such as Armour and Swift, and their apparent ability to manipulate consumer prices. In July 1910, Rags tangled with a saucy and imprudent bulldog on the streets of Decatur. The brawl ranged over a full city block, with the overmatched Rags eventually retreating, a little wiser and minus a good portion of his left ear. Rags never failed to bring out the softer side of even the most hard-bitten trainman. The Daily Review of Decatur noted that “not one of them would any more think of throwing Rags from a car or hurling a brick at him than he would of cursing the ghost of his grandmother.” The last known appearance of Rags in the Twin Cities dates to early August 1912, when the “well-known interurban and streetcar mascot” spent a day riding the city car line to and from downtown Bloomington to the west side Union depot. “Rags comes and goes,” observed The Pantagraph, “but is always welcome.” What eventually became of Rags is not known, at least to this author. One hopes, though, that whatever doggie heaven Rags now calls home, he’s aboard an interurban car, his face turned to the wind, and a smiling motorman at his side.",

    "content": "Well before Jackie Robinson broke the Major League Baseball color line in 1947. Latin Americans had already made inroads into the lily-white world of the “national pastime.” The catch, of course, was that these mostly Spanish-speaking players— from places like Columbia, Cuba and Mexico—had to be light skinned. Black Latin Americans could only play in the Negro Leagues. In 1902, Columbian-born Luis Manuel Castro suited up for the Philadelphia Athletics, becoming the first Latin American in the modern era of Major League Baseball. Others followed in a slow trickle, including Cuban-born starting pitcher Dolf Luqu, who won 194 games in a career that ended in 1935. In 1938, the best player for the hometown minor league Bloomington Bloomers was 22-year-old Cuban catcher Chico Hernandez. Born in Havana in 1916, Salvador Jose Ramos Hernandez—“Chico” was once a common nickname for Latin ballplayers—would eventually play two years for the Chicago Cubs. During his one season in Bloomington, Pantagraph sports editor Fred Young described him as a “husky six-foot Cuban with a broken accent.” At the time, the Bloomers were members of the Illinois-Indiana-Iowa League, one of the nation’s oldest and most respected low minor “loops.” In 1938, the Three-I League (it was also called the “Three Eye” and “Triple Orb”) featured four teams from Illinois (Bloomington, Decatur, Moline, and Springfield), one from Indiana (Evansville), and three from Iowa (Cedar Rapids, Clinton, and Waterloo). Hernandez had come to Bloomington by way of the Montgomery (Alabama) Bombers of the Southeastern League, which like Bloomington was affiliated with Milwaukee of the American Association and Cleveland of the American League. The 1938 Bloomers were managed by former big league catcher Bob O’Farrell, National League MVP in 1926 for the World Series champion Cardinals. “He intends to don the shin guards and mask many times before the year is over, but just now he doesn’t exactly see how he can take Chico Hernandez out of the lineup,” observed Fred Young on May 8. “The Cuban … has shown a good arm and lots of power.” In fact, Hernandez would “don the shin guards and mask” for all 121 Three Eye games that season. The Bloomers played at Fans Field on the city’s far south side, an aging facility with a rickety wooden grandstand. At the time, the old ball yard doubled as the McLean County 4-H fairgrounds, an arrangement that necessitated a two-week road trip in August during fair time. In addition to Hernandez, the 15-man Bloomers lineup included Bud Adams, Streator boy made good; infielder Milton “Moon” Mullen, fresh from a stint as skipper of a Titusville, Pennsylvania, semi-pro club; and Joe Skurski, a 22-year-old Pole from Chicago’s Englewood High School. The Bloomers final game was Sunday, September 4, a wild 12-10 victory over the Springfield Browns at the “House of O’Farrell” (as Young sometimes called Fans Field). A nice crowd turned out to bid farewell to Hernandez, who left that night to join the Milwaukee Brewers for what remained of the American Association season. As Bloomington’s most popular player, the team honored him with a gold watch. Hernandez was the only Bloomer to make the Three-I League’s 11-man all-star team, batting a healthy .337 in 442 plate appearances. The Bloomer backstop, though, was outshined by Moline’s Lou “the Mad Russian” Novikoff, who led the league in batting average (.367), as well as hits and RBIs. Despite winning their final four games, the Bloomers ended the 1938 season in seventh place with a 56-65 record. The Evansville Bees finished atop the standings, though in the league’s four-team playoff they lost to the Moline Plowboys, who in turn defeated the Decatur Commodores (known as the “Commies”) to capture the postseason crown. Ever the optimist, Fred Young of The Pantagraph pointed to Bloomington’s season attendance of 30,000-plus as a bright spot in an otherwise disappointing campaign. That figure, though, fell well short of Evansville’s gate total of some 100,000 fans, or Springfield’s 75,000. In truth, Bloomington was finding it increasingly difficult to compete against rivals with better management and greater community support, and the 1939 season would prove to be the city’s last in the old Three Eye. Hernandez appeared in 90 Major League games over the 1942 and 1943 seasons, all with the Chicago Cubs. Though far from an all-star career, Hernandez made baseball history in 1942 when he and right-hander Hiram “Hi” Bithorn of Puerto Rico formed the first all-Latin American “battery,” the term for the pitcher and catcher. Salvador Jose Ramos Hernandez passed away in Havana on January 3, 1986 at the age of 70.",

    "content": "There are few lovelier corners of McLean County than Moraine View State Recreation Area. Situated several miles north of LeRoy, the 1,687-acre park is crowned by the calm waters of 158-acre Dawson Lake. The establishment of the park in 1959 and the subsequent construction of the artificial lake in 1962-1963 represented the culmination of a spirited campaign for such a public works project dating to the 1920s. Yet our story, naturally, goes back much longer. Moraine View owes its name to the fact that it’s situated atop the Bloomington moraine, one of the largest such end moraines in the state. Moraines date to the closing chapter of the Wisconsin glaciation (colloquially known as the last Ice Age) some 20,000 to 25,000 years ago. During periodic standstills in the ice sheet’s methodical, melty retreat, ground up rock and other loose material carried by the ice were deposited at its front end, creating ridgelines arcing across the northeastern section of the state and into east-central Illinois. The elevated, relatively dry terrain of the Bloomington moraine—rising as it does in some sections 100 feet above the surrounding soggy tallgrass prairie—attracted indigenous people for millennia. Well before the arrival of the first Euro-American settlers in the 1820s, the Kickapoo had established a semi-permanent village on east edge of what was once a 14,000-acre old-growth woodlands running along the spine of the moraine. Today, a two-acre-plus vestige of the “Grand Village” site, which is located several miles east of Moraine View State Recreation Area, is set aside to commemorate the Kickapoo people, and every other year or so it’s home to a pow-wow. More than a century after the U.S. government forcibly removed the Kickapoo from Illinois, progress-minded LeRoy citizens began advocating for the construction of an artificial lake in close proximity to their town. Pro-lake interests—led by the LeRoy Sportsmen’s Club, the local American Legion, the LeRoy Kiwanis and others—contended that a such a project would boost the local economy by bringing hunters, picnickers, hikers, horseback riders, boaters and campers (and, most importantly, their disposable dollars) into the area. In July 1941, five months before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the Roosevelt Administration’s Works Progress Administration signed off on a proposed $135,000 lake, to be located just east of LeRoy in Empire Township, on a stretch of the north folk of Salt Creek, itself a tributary of the Sangamon River. Funding for the project had to come partly from local sources. Consequently, it was decided that LeRoy and Empire Township residents had to first approve the creation of a park district and elect board members before they could then vote on a $30,000 bond issue, which would cover the community’s share of the project. The first election—involving the establishment of a park district and election of board members—was held Dec. 16, 1941. In LeRoy, voters backed the lake project by a nearly two-to-one margin, while those in the township leaned the other way, saying “no” by a closely contested vote of 104 to 83. Combined, those favoring the project prevailed 401 to 262. Yet passage depended on a majority in both districts, meaning the 21-vote difference in the township canceled out the overall 139 majority. Although lake supporters questioned the fairness—if not outright legitimacy—of the result, the increasing attention given to the world war and the all-out homefront effort apparently hampered plans for a legal challenge. In other words, the lake project was dead in the water. More than a decade-and-a-half later, in the late 1950s, support for a new lake resurfaced. This time around, it looked like a sure thing, seeing as the state was eagerly expanding its park and recreation acreage. And indeed, in 1958, the state approved the establishment of a park and construction of a corresponding lake, though it was now sighted north of LeRoy in Dawson Township. This lake—with its southern edge 2½ miles north of LeRoy and its northern edge 1½ miles south of Ellsworth—was created by impounding the upper reaches of the north fork of Salt Creek. The planned park was first known as the McLean County Conservation Area, while the lake was simply called McLean County Lake. The McLean County Sportsmen’s Club solicited suggestions for snappier names, receiving suggestions such as Davis Lake, in honor of Judge David Davis of Bloomington, and Stevenson Lake, after Adlai Stevenson, the former governor and two-time candidate for U.S. president who grew up in the Twin Cities. In the end, the county selected Dawson, for Dawson Township and its namesake, John Dawson, who with his family came to Old Town Timber in 1826, becoming in the process the first Euro-American pioneers to the area. The suggestion of Dawson Lake came from Frances Wagers, a longtime resident of the area who in 1972 authored a 31-page typed history of the park and lake. In 1959 and into 1960, before much work could begin on the new lake, the state had to first clear title of something like 900 to 1,000 acres of privately owned farmland and timber. Landholders included Minnie Bane, A.M. Campbell, Frank Wahlstrom, Frank Virgiel and others. Knapp Brothers of Eureka received the contract to clear a stretch of the creek valley of timber, as the acreage would soon be inundated with impounded water. Paulter Brothers of Chester, Ill. oversaw the construction of the quarter-mile long earthen dam and concrete spillway (see accompanying photo.) In the fall of 1975, twelve years after Dawson’s Lake’s completion, the state renamed the surrounding parkland Moraine View State Park. “Here we had a large park and lake area and a great number of people didn’t know it,” Charles Tamminga of the Illinois Department of Conservation said at the time. “We think the new name will help out. It seems a more logical name and it’s flashy.” Twenty years after the first name change, the state park was re-designated a state recreation area, meaning that today it’s officially known as Moraine View State Recreation Area, though plenty of folks still call it a state park—and truth be told, nobody seems to mind! In addition to the bird watching, camping, boating, and fishing, Moraine View is a popular site for hunters during the annual whitetail deer, pheasant and wild turkey seasons. In her 1972 history of Dawson Lake, Frances Wagers paid tribute to her Swedish immigrant parents, Charles and Jennie Carlson, who in the early 1890s settled 3½ miles south of Ellsworth. It was, Wagers said, “the first home they ever owned.” “It was here my brothers and sister spent part of their childhood days,” Wagers noted in her introduction. “It was here we had the friendship of our neighbors and shared their happy times and their sad moments.” The old Wagers’ farmstead, though, was one of a good number lost to the rising waters of Dawson Lake. Nonetheless, Frances Wagers embraced the new lake and its picturesque views and wildlife, all the while never forgetting what it once looked like it, and what it meant to the people who once called it home. “Even though there was the loss of the people’s homes,” she observed, “it has brought about a place of beauty.”",

    "content": "One hundred and forty years ago this week, on Sept. 18, 1879, the incomparable Sojourner Truth spoke at Second Presbyterian Church in downtown Bloomington. The elderly but still spry civil rights activist and suffragist—who at the time was in her early 80s—was passing through Central Illinois on her way to Kansas to survey the progress made by African-American “Exodusters” fleeing the violence and repression of an unreconstructed South. For reasons lost to time, Truth, while in Bloomington, stayed at the East Chestnut Street residence of George S. Smith, who was manager of Durley Hall. Initially, there were no plans for her to lecture in the city, but soon enough a call went out (the 1897 talk is believed to be Truth’s only public appearance in the Twin Cities.) “Even at her advanced age, she regularly lectures every day, and is strong in her sentiments supporting the ‘old Union,’” noted the Bloomington Daily Leader newspaper. “If a suitable place could be provided for her in the city, she would deliver her lecture on Thursday night [Sept. 18] of this week.” Second Presbyterian Church proved to be a “suitable place” for Truth to speak, which made sense given the congregation’s anti-slavery history and attachment to progressives causes. Born enslaved as Isabella Baumfree about the year 1797, in upstate New York, Sojourner Truth spoke only “low-Dutch” until she was nine or so years old (this was at a time when slavery was still practiced in much of the North.) In 1826, she escaped to freedom with her infant daughter, and several years later secured the freedom of a son enslaved in Alabama. In 1843, Isabella Baumfree took the powerful name Sojourner Truth. Although she never learned to read or write, Truth became an indispensible moral voice for the abolition of slavery and later African-American civil and political rights in the Reconstruction and post-Reconstruction eras. She also advocated for other progressive issues—from prison reform to women’s suffrage. Upon paying Truth a visit before her Bloomington talk, a Pantagraph scribe found the “aged Christian and philanthropist” relaxing in a rocking chair and chatting with friends and admirers. “She was plainly dressed … a white silk handkerchief tied loosely over her shoulders, and a white cap upon her head,” related the reporter. “To her the paths of literature and science were forever closed, but despite the double burdens of poverty and the bane of caste, she has acquired fame and gained friends and admirers among the noblest and best in the land.” Sojourner Truth was known as the “Libyan Sibyl,” a reference to the prophetic priestess of Classical mythology who foretold the “coming of the day when that which is hidden shall be revealed.” The deadlocked 1876 presidential election ended with the so-called Compromise of 1877 whereby the Republican Party surrendered federal supervision over the former Confederacy in exchange for four more years in the White House. The withdrawal of U.S. troops and oversight authority accelerated the return of white racist rule, economic subjugation and terror, and the spread of ever-more pernicious Jim Crow laws (that’s why the Compromise of 1877 is also known as the “Great Betrayal.”) Given such conditions in the Deep South, African Americans looked to migrate to the Great Plains and elsewhere for their rightful piece of the American pie. “Exoduster” was the term given to southern black refugees, mostly from the states of Mississippi and Louisiana, leaving the Deep South mainly for Kansas, but also for Oklahoma and Colorado (“exodus” refers to the Old Testament flight of the Jews from Egypt.) It’s estimated that some 40,000 Exodusters participated in the “Exodus of 1879” (though the migration lasted more than one year.) “It is her present purpose to visit Kansas and look over the Exodus Movement, which she has watched with much solicitude, and desires to look into with her own eyes,” stated The Pantagraph. “Her desire to visit the scene of its operations is not only natural but commendable, and her intention to ‘lecture’ her way out there, (she has no other means) will doubtless meet an encouraging response from all philanthropic people.” At Second Presbyterian Church, Truth lectured for an hour and a half. Her talk, noted The Daily Leader, was “humorous, practical, and full of wisdom.” The Leader also reprinted a few of her “sayings” from the Bloomington talk. “The beginning was when the first wrong was done, and the end will be when wrong doing is stopped,” she said at one point. “Ministers preach Christ and him crucified; they should rather preach Christ alive and risen in men,” she said later on. “Sojourner also prides herself on a fairly correct English, which is in all sense a foreign tongue to her, she having spent her early years among people speaking ‘Low Dutch, N.Y.,’” observed The Pantagraph. “People who report [on] her often exaggerate her expressions, putting into her mouth the most marked southern dialect, which Sojourner feels is rather taking an unfair advantage of her.” Yet the following spring, The Pantagraph did just that in a column of brief news and advertising notices. “Sojourner Truth,” declared this paper, “says she has prayed for years that the colored people would pack up and ‘just leave dat’ar wicked Souf.” Later this week, on Wed., Sept. 18—exactly 140 years to the day of the Bloomington lecture—Second Presbyterian Church will hold a Sojourner Truth Celebration. The highlights will include historical reenactor Patricia James Davis of Springfield portraying Truth, and gospel music from the combined choirs of Second Presbyterian and Mount Pisgah Baptist churches. The program—free and open to the public—begins at 7 p.m. Sojourner Truth is one of five women associated with the American suffrage movement who will begin appearing on the back of the $10 bill by sometime next year. Or at least that’s the hope, for the current presidential administration recently announced the inexplicable postponement until 2028 of similar plans to replace Andrew Jackson with Harriet Tubman as the face of the $20 bill. Tubman escaped slavery and then helped hundreds of other enslaved individuals make their way to freedom on the Underground Railroad. “Her memory is still remarkable,” a Pantagraph reporter said of Sojourner Truth back in 1879, “and flashes of wit and wisdom still emanate from her soul like the rays of the natural sun as it bursts forth from a somber cloud, baptizing earth and sky with the radiance of its expiring glory.”",

    "content": "“Unfortunate souls who spend Christmas Day in the county jail will at least have a tasty dinner to help them mull over their predicament,” noted the Dec. 25, 1945 Pantagraph. Indeed, McLean County Sheriff Earl Richard oversaw a holiday meal of “baked chicken and sage dressing, mashed and sweet potatoes, creamed corn, scalloped oysters, celery, cranberry sauce and hot rolls.” There were only seven prisoners “lolling” about their cells that Christmas Eve morning 71 years ago. Jailers, though, knew from experience that more than few of their fellow citizens were bound to overdo it with the “Yule cheer” and end up at the county clink before the first course of the big meal was served at noon Christmas Day. Some of more festive holiday meals for local prisoners were held in the first half of the 20th century at the old county jail that immediately predated the McLean County Detention Facility (as the current jail is called). Many longtime area residents will remember this jail (see accompanying image), located at the corner of Madison and Monroe streets on the west end of downtown Bloomington. Completed in 1882 as the fifth jail in the county’s history, it remained open a remarkable 95 years, finally closing on March 1, 1977. For many years, until the county employed a jail cook, the sheriff’s wife normally handled the Christmas meals. In 1900, for example, Sheriff George Johnson’s spouse Carrie prepared a turkey dinner for 31 prisoners. The Johnsons also gave each inmate a Christmas card, handkerchief, candy, nuts and popcorn. Either turkey or chicken (the latter baked, roasted or sometimes fried) was usually the main entree, though it was roast pork in 1912, along with “sage dressing, cranberries, celery, potatoes, bread, butter and apples in large quantities.” During this Christmas meal, reported The Pantagraph, prisoners “ate heartily, paced in and around the corridors and chatted among themselves of the significance of the day and the pleasures which were being enjoyed by the outer world.” One inmate, though, kept to herself. Mae Gottschalk, held by the grand jury for the murder of her husband George, “sat quietly in the women’s ward and waited for the dusk, when she could again go to sleep.” On Christmas Day 1915, there were 52 inmates in the county jail, including several federal prisoners from Springfield and five women. They were treated to fried chicken—of the “young and tender variety”—and many all-American sides. In addition, most male inmates received a “few Havanas” (cigars), while those that did not smoke were given “plug cut” (chewing tobacco). The afternoon that year included a “moving picture show” program featuring a four-part drama and a closing comedy. Roy Strain and his wife brought in a Victrola and some phonograph records to provide musical accompaniment to the silent shorts. In its Christmas Day reporting, The Pantagraph often grouped the county jail with other public and charitable institutions. Thus accounts of prisoner meals appeared alongside those from the Illinois Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Children’s School, the McLean County Poor Farm, the McLean County Home for Colored Children and other such places. As one would expect, this coverage could be a tad condescending, moralizing, saccharine and self-congratulatory (look how wonderfully humane our jail is!) That said, such attention was also an expression of genuine concern for the welfare of local prisoners—albeit if only for one day out of the year. On Dec. 26, 1923, The Pantagraph published a letter from county inmate Robert Payne thanking Jennie “Mother Morrison,” wife of Sheriff J.E. Morrison, for a Christmas dinner of chicken, all the “fixins,” homemade mince pie and fruit cake. “We all know that there is always much merrymaking and good wishes going the rounds at this, our yuletide season,” Payne wrote, “and there are, undoubtedly, unfortunate persons here and there who have been overlooked, but I want to say that there is not one [inmate] who has been forgotten by the ‘mother’ of the county jail, Mrs. J.E. Morrison, who has labored untiringly that the inmates might have a merry Christmas with a feast and presents.” Whether Payne wrote this letter of his own volition or at the “suggestion” of a jailer is unknown, though the effusive praise for Jennie Morrison leads one to suspect this was a heartfelt effort without hint of coercion. On Christmas Eve 1925, Sheriff Morrison treated the inmates to a Victrola concert and a performance by Chicago baritone Frederick Bethel. A nephew of Sheriff Morrison, Bethel was in town with a traveling theater company performing the operetta “The Student Prince.” And Charlotte Morison, the young daughter of Deputy Sheriff Ike Morrison, played Santa by distributing candy, nuts and tobacco to the inmates. Christmas featured a roast chicken dinner in the afternoon and an oyster supper later in the evening Two years later at the county jail, the highlights of Christmas Day 1927 included a chicken dinner, caroling and a service led by local evangelist Billy Shelper, founder of Home Sweet Home Mission. A few days earlier, a Pantagraph reporter paid a visit to the jail and talked to one of the prisoners. “And Christmas, what does it mean to all of you?” asked the reporter. “It means a good ‘feed,’ which the sheriff has promised us,” replied the inmate. “It means, too, a special celebration among ourselves, with songs by our ‘choir’ and an impromptu program some time during the day. Christmas, you know, gets celebrated inside a jail, as well as out, and whether one has friends outside who remember or not, doesn’t keep the men with whom you spend it, from sharing what they receive.” Today, Christmas Day 2016, McLean County Jail inmates will enjoy a turkey dinner. County officials expect to serve about 210 men and women. The day after Christmas 1926, a prisoner called a Pantagraph reporter to his cell, asking that he publish a thank you letter on behalf of those currently jailed. The anonymous letter noted the “culinary efforts” of June Nierstheimer (wife of Sheriff Walter Nierstheimer) and Hattie Boyer, the county jail “matron.” “Their Christmas Day achievements have put to shame some of the country’s finest chefs,” the letter read. The baked chicken dinner and sides were “all served in generous portions and prepared in a manner that carried us back in thought, to Mother’s Christmas dinners.” “These recollections,” added the prisoner, “bring mist to the eyes of many.”",

    "content": "During World War I, several dozen Bloomington-Normal residents fought in an African-American regiment that earned a reputation for bravery and ferocity, so much so that it’s said they were known as the “Black Devils” by the Germans. Until 1948 and President Harry Truman’s order to desegregate the U.S. Armed Forces, African-Americans served in all-black units. At the start of WW I, for instance, dozens of “colored” residents from Bloomington-Normal and nearby communities served in Co. K of the Chicago-based Eighth Regiment, Illinois National Guard. Co. K received orders to mobilize on July 26, 1917, and its men had but a few hours to gather at Bloomington’s Illinois Traction passenger station before they boarded interurban cars for Peoria. Wishing them farewell were a good many members of the local African-American community. Bloomington’s newest doughboys, reported The Pantagraph, “stuck their heads and hands out of the windows, and in some cases the greater part of their bodies, and shook hands with their friends, kissed their mothers or sweethearts [and] yelled their goodbyes to their friends.” It would be a long nineteenth months before these men returned home, if at all. After extended training in Peoria and Camp Logan, Houston, Texas, the reorganized 8th, now the 370th Infantry Regiment, arrived in France on April 22, 1918. The American Expeditionary Force and Gen. John J. Pershing didn’t want anything to do with black troops, so the 370th and three black regiments comprising the 93rd Infantry Division fought alongside the French. The 370th fought at Lorraine and Oise-Aisne, among other battles and campaigns. In mid-August 1918, the regiment arrived at Verdun, and one month later took a position in the front lines trenches. Beginning Sept. 14 and continuing for nearly two weeks, the 370th, commanded entirely by black officers, faced hard fighting, shelling and poison gas attacks. The Germans called them “Black Devils” for good reason—though the French, referring to their swagger and pride, called those of the 370th “Partridges” (think of puffed-up chests). Local men from the 370th receiving special citations for bravery included Alonzo Walton of Normal, who carried supplies to his company during a German barrage, and Donald Luster and Harry L. Pierson, who ventured into “no man’s land” (the killing zone between the Allied and German lines) in an attempt to retrieve wounded comrades. A French general praised the 370th, declaring that the spilled blood of black American soldiers mixed with that of their French brothers-in-arms, rendering “indissoluble the bonds of affection that unite us.” Bloomington staged a grand celebration for its returning “colored soldier boys” on Feb. 27, 1919, an all-day affair that included a parade through downtown, a banquet at Wayman AME Church (then located on the 800 block of North Center Street), and a reception and dance at the old Coliseum. Speakers at the reception included Mayor E.E. Jones, Dr. Eugene Covington, a local African-American physician; Bloomington attorney and Jewish civil rights leader Sigmund Livingston; and Wayman minster Henry Simons. The featured speaker was Adelbert Roberts, an African-American state representative from Chicago (in 1924 he became the first black state senator in Illinois). “I was glad when I got to Bloomington to see the best white people join the best black people of the city in a welcome for these ‘Black Devils,’” Roberts said. “A government that is great and grand enough to carry democracy over the seas . . . is great enough to spread it to the colored race at home. Give these boys a chance. They kept Old Glory afloat in the breeze.” On Jun. 9, Roberts returned to Bloomington to address the first public meeting of the newly formed local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). According to The Pantagraph, he made “an eloquent appeal to the white people to give the colored race an opportunity for the higher positions in labor.” African Americans, Roberts noted, had limited employment opportunities, hindering their economic mobility and integration into wider middle class life. Less than two months after this speech, Chicago erupted in a spasm of racial violence. The deadliest race riot in state history began on Jul. 27 when an African-American boy ventured into the white section of an informally segregated city beach, and things didn’t quiet down until Aug. 3. By the time the civil unrest was over, 38 people were dead. In the 1910s, hundreds of thousands of African Americans left the rural South for the urban North. The Great Migration, as is would be called, increased tension and racial animosity in cities such as Chicago and Detroit. In Bloomington, race relations steadily deteriorated in the 1920s as they did throughout much of the nation. At this time Bloomington city officials and community leaders sanctioned a de facto system of segregation that banned blacks from most downtown restaurants and hotels, and offered segregated seating in theaters. As black and white blood ran in the streets of Chicago in late July 1919, Bloomington park officials doubled down on maintaining segregated beaches at Miller Park. Charles Thomas, a 370th veteran who ended the war a sergeant, served as custodian for the small African-American beach and its wood frame bathhouse (black and white beach facilities at Miller Park were anything but “separate but equal.”) On Jul. 30, The Pantagraph attempted to put a positive spin on this shameful arrangement. Thomas, described as a “strapping big husky attendant,” gamely downplayed the controversy, as he likely had no interest in endangering his job by speaking out. “After going though the thickest of the fighting on the Western Front in France last year,” noted a tone deaf Pantagraph, “Thomas says that a little agitation like that raised over the Jim Crow bathing facilities at Miller Park isn’t going to bother him.” Veterans’ organizations were also segregated at the time, so local veterans of the 370th and other African-American units organized their own American Legion post in Bloomington. The Redd-Williams Post No. 163 honored two men from the 370th killed in France, John Redd and Gus Williams. The Simpkins Military History Museum in Heyworth has a new display commemorating the 100th anniversary of the American entry into the “Great War.” Original items on view include a “Black Devil” identification tag stamped “George Stewart, Sergt Co K 370 USNG” (the last abbreviation is short for U.S. National Guard). Bloomington resident George Stewart, a chauffeur before the war (a common occupation for black men back then), fought with the 370th to war’s end. Upon returning to Bloomington, he worked as a city hall custodian, among other jobs. In 1953 he even ran for a seat on the city council (he lost). Stewart passed away in 1959, and his widow, Grace Huddleston, donated his ID tag and other WW I items to Heyworth museum owner Gary Simpkins.",

    "content": "Ah, the good old days when all fathers were breadwinners and all mothers were homemakers. Well, those days were never so simple, nor were they so good, at least for the many working class families whose mothers had to earn a living outside the home. Although it may come as a surprise to many traditionalists who yearn for an American past that never was, the lack of daycare for working mothers was an issue that goes back more than a century. Locally, such a need led independent, reform-minded women to establish Bloomington’s Day Nursery (what we would call a daycare center today) on the city’s working-class west side. Back then the west side included the Chicago and Alton Railroad Shops and the McLean County Coal Co., both of which employed a large number of foreign-born men. And many of their wives and other working-class women had factory floor jobs at local candy maker Paul F. Beich Co., also located on the west side. The Day Nursery, opened in early 1908, provided a safe, professionally run and low-cost daycare center for working mothers. From its very beginning the nursery also doubled as a settlement house, a type of social service center patterned after Progressive Era reformer Jane Addams’ Hull House in Chicago. The Bloomington Day Nursery and Social Settlement Association (as it became known) eventually offered immigrant and neighborhood families a wide range of programs. In addition to childcare, there were cooking, sewing, “physical culture” (exercise), art and folk dance classes. Other services included a branch of the public library and an employment bureau that matched west side residents with “requests for help from the east side” (these usually entailed calls for domestic work—housekeepers, nannies, chauffeurs and the like). During its formative years no one was more closely associated with the Day Nursery than Jane “Jennie” Lynd Thompson. Mary McDowell, a contemporary of Addams who ran the University of Chicago Settlement House on that city’s south side, was known as the “Angel of the Stockyards.” Keeping that in mind, one could just as well call Jennie Thompson the “Angel of Bloomington’s West Side.” The Day Nursery was first located in a small, wood-frame residence on the 1200 block of West Mulberry Street. Five years later the nursery moved into roomier quarters a block west on the same street, and two years after this former single-family home was substantially remodeled and enlarged. Remarkably, the house is still there today looking much as it did nearly 100 years ago, though it’s now back to serving as a private residence. In order to meet growing expenses, Day Nursery supporters established the Women’s Exchange in downtown Bloomington. This enterprise involved local women selling cakes, pies and various baked goods, as well as needle and other “fancy work,” with profits going to nursery and settlement house operations. Many area women took understandable pride in the fact that both the Day Nursery and Women’s Exchange were managed and operated entirely by the supposedly “fairer sex.” “Miss Jennie,” as Thompson would be called by a generation of west side children, was a beloved figure in the Twin Cities. Neighborhood women valued her know-how, patience and temperament as they came to depend on her uncanny ability to smooth over the many wrinkles in their working-class lives. The West Mulberry Street center eventually included a health clinic, though they called it a dispensary, with local physicians and nurses volunteering their time. Patients were charged a nominal fee, based on ability to pay, or nothing at all. Minor surgeries were even performed there, including many tonsillectomies. The Day Nursery and Social Settlement Association was established at a time of de facto segregation in the Twin Cities. Black residents and visitors were not allowed to stay at downtown Bloomington hotels or eat at downtown restaurants, and were directed to separate seating areas in local theaters. By the end of World War I the locally run homes for orphaned and neglected children were even segregated by race—black children were sent to the McLean County Home for Colored Children while their white counterparts resided at the Girls’ Industrial Home or Victory Hall in Normal. That being said, African Americans had access to some (though apparently not all) nursery and settlement house services. In her 1915 report, Thompson called for the establishment of a parallel day nursery to meet the needs of working African-American mothers. It wasn’t until the 1940s, though, that the Day Nursery could promise black working-class families a welcoming place in which “no color line is drawn.” Too often Day Nursery backers, many of whom were well-intentioned middle- and upper-class mainline Protestants, adopted a patronizing tone when referring to working-class west side residents, many of whom were foreign-born or Catholic—or both. “English is making individuals out of these foreigners,” declared settlement house language instructor C.F. Schreiber in early 1909. “The foreigner lives in groups and he has a group thought. As soon as he learns enough English words to dare to venture into a conversation with an American and gets into our sphere of thought, then he becomes an individual … Let us see how many Americans we can make out of these immigrants.” Many programs were designed with such “Americanization” goals in mind, especially during the “super-patriot” agitation of World War I and the reactionary politics of the early 1920s. The Day Nursery was even home to a chapter of the Children of the Republic, a Boy Scouts-like organization established by the Daughters of the American Revolution. This group aimed at inculcating in the children of immigrant parents “patriotism, the creed of the flag, the meaning of the salute and other lessons tending to make them true Americans when they grow up.” The Day Nursery remained in operation on West Mulberry Street until 1968. That year the nursery relocated to 315 N. Stilwell St. and became known as the Day Care Center of McLean County. In 2008, it was renamed the Milestones Early Learning Center and six years later a new home was opened on Six Points Road. One-hundred-and-eight years after its founding the old Day Nursery is still helping those in need! Jennie Thompson passed away on Jan. 13, 1924, at the age of 63. Her death was called “a bewildering blow” to the Day Nursery, “so great was her worth in her special line of settlement work and so rare and beautiful her character.” It was fitting that her earthly remains laid in state at the West Mulberry Street nursery and settlement house, where hundreds of west side folk could say their final goodbyes to “Miss Jennie.” They knew as well as any east side do-gooder philanthropist that Thompson had played an instrumental role in making the Day Nursery “an outpost of humanity, radiating love, help and encouragement.” Thompson is one of eight characters featured in the McLean County Museum of History’s annual Evergreen Cemetery Walk. This popular event, which has become an autumn tradition for many area residents and families, will be held the weekends of Oct. 1-2 and Oct. 8-9.

    "content": "Local and state governments often offer incentives to keep existing businesses or attract new ones. These inducements—in the form of land giveaways, promised infrastructure improvements, tax rebates and the like—can prove controversial, causing some public officials and voters to recoil at the prospect of spending public dollars on private enterprise. Controversial or not, local leaders have employed this economic development approach for more than a century to either retain or lure businesses, which were usually manufacturers. One common method to raise funds was by means of a subscription campaign, either limited to the business community or opened to the wider public. One of the most successful campaigns of this type occurred in 1910 when area residents pledged money to keep the Chicago & Alton (C&A) Railroad Shops in Bloomington. From the Civil War era into the early 20th century, the largest local employer was the C&A Railroad, which operated a sprawling repair shops and rail yard complex on Bloomington’s west side. It was within this “city-unto-itself” that an army of skilled craftsmen and semi-skilled laborers maintained, repaired, and refurbished steam locomotives and freight and passenger cars. This work required the attention of upwards of 2,000 or more boilermakers, machinists, pattern makers, carpenters, painters, upholsters and others. In addition, the shops served as the home for locomotive engineers, firemen, brakemen and conductors who plied the rails on C&A passenger and freight trains. Around 1910 word spread that C&A officials were looking to abandon Bloomington and its increasingly cramped west side shops for greener and roomier “pastures” elsewhere. Spurring the need for relocation or expansion were ever larger and more powerful steam locomotives that required more and more space for maintenance work and such. Around 1910 the C&A began upgrading its motive power roster by purchasing 20 state-of-the-art Mikado-type locomotives. Another complement of Mikados and even larger engines would soon follow. When it came to the C&A Shops, Springfield, Ill. was happy to play the role of jobs “poacher” by offering ample free land as an incentive for relocation. Bloomington business leaders, obviously, were not willing to stand idly by as the C&A abandoned the city without a fight. Accordingly, they drew up their own incentive package to help facilitate expansion of the existing west side site. The plan created by the Bloomington Business Men’s Association entailed raising $165,000 (the equivalent of more than $4.2 million today, adjusted for inflation) from area residents for a C&A Shops improvement fund. This money, raised during a 40-day campaign in the spring of 1910, was then used to buy property and demolish homes north and west of the shops to make room for much needed expansion. In exchange for raising enough money to purchase and clear adjacent land, the C&A agreed to invest around $1 million in enlarging and upgrading the shops, with most money going for new buildings, equipment and trackage. Around six blocks of scattered residential development, which included some 50 or more houses were eventually cleared to make way for the expansion. The parcels in question zigzagged north and west of the shops, but roughly speaking, involved much of the land north of Graham Street and east of Morris Avenue. The fundraising campaign got underway sometime in late April and picked up “steam” (pun intended) over a two-week period in late May. There were rallies and speeches on the courthouse square and all sorts of call-to-action events. On May 26, for instance, women and children fanned out across the community selling “Boost Bigger, Beautiful Bloomington” buttons, with all proceeds going to the C&A Shops improvement fund. The collections of the McLean County Museum of History include one of these red-and-white pinback buttons. In the end the campaign collected nearly $179,000. About $1,800 remained after acquiring the land, and another $4,700 was earned from the salvage of buildings and building materials. That money, around $6,500, was then rebated to subscribers. The first stage of the C&A Shops expansion project was completed in 1911 with the erection of a new 44-stall roundhouse (see accompanying photograph). The roundhouse featured a 100-foot turntable, two 100,000-gallon steel water tanks and a 600-ton coaling dock that could simultaneously service four locomotives on four separate tracks. In early May 1913, C&A President B.A. Worthington announced the second and final phase of the expansion project, promising Bloomington that it would soon be home to “the best planned and equipped shops in the country.” The expansion, completed in late 1914, included the erection of a mammoth machine shop; freight car repair shop; storehouse and office building; oil house; blacksmith shop; and pattern storage building; among other structures. There were also additional capital improvements, such as a 10-ton capacity yard crane; a dry kiln; paint, oil, and waste stores; and additional trackage to improve the yard’s capacity to shuttle locomotives and rolling stock into, around, and out of the shops. When it was all said and done, the C&A spent around $1.8 million on the expansion project, well in excess of the amount promised in the initial agreement. Little did anyone know it at the time, but the golden age of steam railroading would be at an end within a few decades, thanks in great measure to the development of diesel locomotives and the increasing popularity of automobiles. Diesel locomotives required far less maintenance than their steam counterparts, and the workforce at the C&A Shops declined in measure. By the early 1950s, the west side shops were a shadow of their former bustling self. On the Alton Railroad the diesel era arrived in 1936 with the inaugural Chicago-to-St. Louis run of the streamlined passenger train “Abraham Lincoln.” Thirteen years later, the Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad, which had bought the Alton, became the first mainline railroad to fully dieselize, a milestone that rated coverage in Life magazine. Furthermore, the automobile was making enormous inroads as a viable alternative to passenger rail service, especially given the rapidly expanding network of “hard” (that is, paved) roads and highways. By the 1930s the Alton faced increasing competition from the national highway that paralleled it for much of the way between Chicago and St. Louis—Route 66. Yet back in the early 1910s, the nation still moved by hulking but elegant steam locomotives, making the west side shops invaluable to the economic vitality of Bloomington. “It’s the C&A Shops and McLean County’s great soil and up-to-date farmers that had made Bloomington the best town in Illinois,” observed The Pantagraph in 1910. “Take either one away and you’ll have a mighty poor city.\"",

    "content": "“I was always too independent,” Bloomington resident Annie May Christian confided in a remarkable scrapbook she compiled around 1903. Unabashedly independent yes, but Christian also knew the value of community, especially one alive to the fine arts. From 1910 to 1923, May Christian (she went by May, not Annie) headed the Amateur Musical Club, a dominant force in the city’s “aesthetic life” for much of the 20th century. She led the club through a period of “outstanding growth in numbers and prestige,” observed The Pantagraph upon her death in 1941, “establishing a standard for musical appreciation and interest on a scale seldom attained in a community of this size.” May was nine or ten old when the Christian family came to Bloomington in 1876. Her father, Matthew, was a former Springfield, Ill. dry goods merchant in poor health who would spend the next 25 years in Bloomington physically disabled. May’s mother, Elizabeth Mitchell Christian, was from McLean County pioneer stock. Elizabeth’s father, Ebenezer Bridge Mitchell (sometimes spelled Mitchel with one “L”), built one of the first log cabins in Stout’s Grove, a forested area west of Danvers. It’s said he moved the family to Bloomington to provide better educational opportunities for his children. Before the Civil War, the family built a home on the 500 block of East Front Street (yes, it’s still there!) And sure enough, in 1860, Elizabeth graduated from Normal University (now ISU) as part of the first class in school history. With Elizabeth’s husband Matthew disabled, the Christian family moved to Bloomington and into the old Mitchell house, with financial support likely coming from farmland on the Mitchell side. May Christian, the subject at hand, was an 1883 graduate of Bloomington High School, this at a time when few children enjoyed public education beyond what we’d call junior high today. As such, Christian’s graduating class was all of fourteen students, thirteen of those being girls. She continued her education by way of musical training, both in voice and piano, and by the age of 17 she was considered “among [Bloomington’s] best instrumental talent.” Her long affiliation with the Amateur Musical Club began in the late 1890s, and soon she was doing things like delivering a paper to members titled “Grand Opera from 1800 to Wagner,” and helping organize the annual Charity Day concert. But it’s as club president for more than a dozen years that Christian made her widest and deepest mark on the Twin Cities. Free Sunday concerts began during her tenure, and the club enjoyed great success bringing nationally known composers, conductors and performers to Bloomington. During her years as president, the club staged a Liszt centenary concert with American tenor Riccardo Martin and pianist and composer Rudolf Ganz; hosted performances by the Chicago Opera Quartet and the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra; and welcomed tenor Enrico Palmetto, violinist and composer Fritz Kreisler, pianist Josef Hofmann and others. May Christian and the Amateur Musical Club were exemplars of a cultural scene dominated by the likes of music instruction, literary societies, piano recitals, poetry, afternoon teas and the reading of history papers. Bloomington-Normal, home to a solid representation of the well-educated middle and upper-middle class, had plenty of whip-smart women who felt constrained and burdened by a patriarchy and its pernicious social, political and economic barriers. Women such as May Christian found outlet in club activities where one could do things like organize fundraisers, study current events and tackle community-wide problems. Christian, for instance, was a member of the influential History Club of Bloomington most of her adult life, serving as president for several terms. She was also one of the organizers of the Bloomington Women’s Club, with its mission to “make it easier for the sentiments and convictions of the women to find expression.” Churchgoing was also a major part of May Christian’s self-identity, as she was long associated with First Presbyterian of Bloomington. In mid-Jan. 1911, she represented the Amateur Musical Club at the 18th annual “Congress of Clubs.” This was a gathering of some 300 members of the “city’s elite” representing more than a dozen local literary and musical associations, including the Longfellow Club, the Four O’clock History Club, Ein Dutzend Club, College Alumni Club, Margaret Fuller Club and the Clio Club. Happily, some of these clubs are still active today! The collections of the McLean County Museum of History archives include a 17-page scrapbook compiled by May Christian around 1903 (see accompanying images.) Each page of this brief autobiographical statement—really a manifesto of sorts—features a clipped illustration from a magazine advertisement or similar source, accompanied by a handwritten observation or declaration. In this work, Christian, who at the time was in her late thirties, unflinchingly addresses her unmarried status. “Some women have men to work for them” is the caption on page five. “I have to work for myself,” is her follow-up on the next page. Yet there is no self-pity, as Christian also expresses her disappointment in—even indifference to—men. Page eight offers a drawing of a man seated at a table and engrossed in a newspaper. “This is the way some men entertain their wives,” she writes. The following page includes an amusing scene of a young man on his knees, in the midst of a proposal, but with the look of shock on his face. “I have had chances to marry,” she notes, before adding on the next page, “But he might have been cross.” “I never would be spoony,” she says a few pages later, “spoony” here meaning behaving unduly sentimental or acting foolishly in love. That page is followed by a well-dressed woman and the aforementioned declaration: “I was always too independent.” Two of the scrapbook’s final pages feature a woman gesturing at an empty chair and the caption, “Still unoccupied,” followed by a woman playing the piano with the observation, “I spend my evening alone.” The last page is an illustration of a cat and the phrase, “My constant companion.” Christian is one of seven real-life local folk from the past showcased in this year’s Evergreen Cemetery Walk. The event, now celebrating its 25th anniversary, is presented by the McLean County Museum of History and Illinois Voices Theatre-Echoes. It’s being held today, Sun., Oct. 6, and next weekend, Oct. 12-13. Annie May Christian passed away on Apr. 14, 1941, at the age of 74. “Such a life of service for others in the interest of artistic culture,” eulogized The Pantagraph, “bequeaths to the city and all Central Illinois a name and a memory which shall last long and with undimmed fragrance.”",

    "content": "In November 1887, a poor local honey harvest led The Pantagraph to predict scarce inventories and high prices. “Biscuit will have to be eaten without the toothsome accompaniment of golden honey,” the paper declared, half-jokingly, “and buckwheat cake must be made to slide down with only the aid of syrup or sugar.” If not quite a matter of life and death, local honey bees were important—gastronomically and economically—to area residents for much of the 19th century. Honey, according to one food historian, “rated as one of the most important items in the frontier diet.” In warmer months, early settlers tracked honeybees back to their hives in order to mark the trees. They would then return in the fall to cut down these bee trees and pilfer the honey and wax. This rapacious activity was known as bee hunting, as opposed to beekeeping. John Benson, Jr., an early arrival to Blooming Grove, a wooded tract south of present-day Bloomington, would travel north some 40 or so miles to the Vermilion River in search of honey. Thomas Buckles, another early settler, participated in a five-week bee hunt on the Kankakee River in which his party located some 50 to 60 bee trees. Isaiah Coon first came to McLean County in 1836, settling near what would become the Village of Towanda. That fall, he journeyed with several others to Iowa—“beyond the range of civilization,” it was said—and after six weeks returned home with four barrels of honey and 125 pounds of beeswax. Interestingly, the honeybee is not indigenous to North America, but arrived here in the early 1600s from Europe. The invasive (but welcomed) species spread westward, staying ahead of Euro-American settlement. Like all natural resources, the pioneer viewed the sweet, sticky stuff as a commodity to be sold or traded in the marketplace. Bee hunter Ethan Newcom, who first settled along the Sangamon River in western Champaign County, once transported 1,000 pounds of honey and 60 pounds of beeswax to Chicago, earning $75 for his trouble. The destructive, unsustainable practice of bee hunting eventually gave way to the husbandry of beekeeping. The area’s first apiarists (the fancy term for beekeeper) often used hollowed-out logs as their first hives. William H. Ball, a resident of the eastern McLean County community of Saybrook, offered a detailed look at beekeeping in an October 1870 letter to The Pantagraph. Ball, who like many local enthusiasts subscribed to the American Bee Journal and followed the tenets of scientific beekeeping, described how his bees “worked” white clover in June, buckwheat in August, and prairie wildflowers in late summer. Others still hewed to the cruder practice of bee hunting. In the early 1870s, William Stansberry, also from the Saybrook area, located in one season 30 bee trees holding some 300 pounds of honey. It appears that 19th century Corn Belt farmers did not generally rely on commercial beekeepers or their own managed hives for targeted pollination (though larger orchards were a likely exception). The reverse, though, was true, in that some grew crops such as clover and buckwheat specifically to “feed” their own bees and boost honey production. Bloomington’s leading “bee man” was undertaker John L. Wolcott, who arrived in the city in the early 1840s. The McLean County Museum of History holds in its collections two Wolcott journals from the 1880s in which he refers to the honeybee as either a “little chap” or “little cuss,” the appellation, of course, depending on the bee’s disposition at the time of handling or observation. Much like the corn farmer, the beekeeper was often at the mercy of the weather. Prolonged bitter cold or blast furnace heat waves and droughts often decimated bee colonies. Wolcott recalled the summer of 1871 or 1872 when his bees were unable to procure enough food to sustain their colonies for the coming winter. Hardships or not, beekeeping remained popular. In late February 1872, the Beekeepers Association of Central Illinois gathered in Bloomington for its annual meeting, with membership a mix of rural folk such as Isaac Smith of Blue Mound Township, and city residents, including Bloomingtonian John Ansley, an insurance agent living on North Prairie Street. By the early 1880s, one of the area’s more successful beekeepers, Henry W. Funk of Dry Grove Township, was harvesting on an annual basis some 15,000 pounds of honey from 75 hives. He was pulling in, on average, 200 pounds of honey for each of his 75 colonies, a remarkable improvement over the average two decades earlier, which was 25 to 30 pounds per colony. In the fall of 1886, Funk sold 12½ pounds worth of clover honey in pails for $1.25 (or around $34 today, adjusted for inflation). Customers could save $1 by buying 4 pails (or 50 pounds net) for $4. For a while, it seemed as if most area farmers kept bees, with the more ambitious enjoying a healthy secondary source of income. “Vast quantities of honey have been yearly sold, and the income derived therefrom has been no inconsiderable factor in increasing the wealth of many of our farmers,” noted The Pantagraph in late 1887. In fact, “it is the exception and not the rule to find a farmer who does not keep at least a few bees.” “The little busy bee,” noted The Pantagraph a few years later, “has always excited the admiration and curiosity of mankind, and has always been associated with the home and the pleasantest relations of life—except now and then, when the little cuss takes a notion to whack a sting into one’s epidermis.” As our thoughts this time of year turn to spring and the birds and the bees, one is reminded of this exquisite nod to the fecundity and ultimate mystery of nature by poet Emily Dickinson: To make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee,— One clover, and a bee, And revery. The revery alone will do If bees are few.",

    "content": "Many longtime Twin City residents will remember long-gone Withers Library, located at the corner of Washington and East streets in downtown Bloomington. Yet all but a handful of folks today—those in their late nineties and older—could recall the Chicago & Alton Railroad Library on the city’s west side. For more than four and a half decades (1879-1926), this library welcomed those who worked at the Chicago & Alton (C&A) Shops, which for many years was the community’s largest and most important employer. It was at this sprawling west side complex where upwards of 1,500 or more skilled and semi-skilled “shopmen” repaired, maintained and constructed steam locomotives and rolling stock—everything from boxcars to Pullman sleeping car prototypes—for the mainline railroad running between Chicago and St. Louis. There were also locomotive engineers, firemen, brakemen, switchmen, conductors and others who rode the rails for the C&A. It’s not known when the west side library was first established, but during the Civil War a group calling itself the C&A Railroad Library Association was already accepting donations of books, maps and other items. The association’s first and only standalone library building (see accompanying photograph) went up in late 1879. The utilitarian yet handsome wood frame structure was located at 806 N. Catherine St., between Chestnut and Walnut streets, on the eastern edge of the C&A Shops (this stretch of Catherine Street no longer exists, as it was later absorbed by the adjacent rail yard). Formal incorporation of the C&A Railroad Library came one year later, in the fall of 1880. The founding organizers included Barbara Prince, wife of attorney Ezra Prince; Fleta Stahl, whose husband was a C&A clerk; John Flynn, a C&A dispatcher; Edwin Edmonds, yardmaster with the C&A; and Robert Bell, a C&A storekeeper. For a modest membership fee, the library was open to C&A employees and their family members. It’s not known, however, if other west side residents were welcomed into the reading room to browse the collections, or perhaps, in some instances, enjoy lending privileges. “A circulation of over 7,000 books last year, with our limited resources, clearly demonstrates the need and importance of having more books, to meet the increasing demand,” read the library association’s report from September 1883. “To the library reading room has recently been added a good piano, two large reading tables, and several additional games of chess, dominoes, &c.” There were also “several prominent daily papers, railroad magazines and pens, ink and writing paper free, for the use and amusement of railroad men, who are cordially invited to spend their leisure time in the rooms of the association.” For many years, Margaret “Maggie” Fenton served as librarian, becoming in the process one of the more beloved and respected figures on the west side. Fenton, who had lost a leg in a cook stove explosion when she was younger, also served as paymaster to the C&A rank and file. How she came to be the distributor of paychecks is not known, but on paydays the library would bustle with activity from morning until night. This role, not surprisingly, endeared her to C&A employees. Fenton was equally at home with both grease-spattered railroaders and their most bookish children. She was an expert telegrapher, but also had a discerning eye when it came to classic literature and popular contemporary fiction and nonfiction. “Miss Fenton,” it was said, “knows as much about literary works as she does about train crews, railroad men in general and all that is to be known about a railroad.” In 1919, The Pantagraph staged a popularity contest to select a young woman to travel to Philadelphia and christen a WW I-era freighter named after Bloomington (the ship was actually called “Evergreen City,” as there was already a “Bloomington” plying the high seas) The lively voting featured more than a half dozen of the city’s most popular socialites in their late teens and twenties. Yet the contest also included “genial and efficient” fortysomething Maggie Fenton. C&A workers, observed The Pantagraph, “think that it is high time that she be given a recognition of some kind for her faithful service as librarian and paycheck distributor.” In the end, thanks to the strong support of west side railroaders, Fenton topped her supposed social betters, receiving 1,198 of the nearly 3,000 votes cast, 140 more than the second-place finisher. Fenton traveled to Philadelphia and christened the freighter on March 20, 1920, accomplishing the ceremonial task with the requisite bottle of champagne. The end of the C&A Library came in the summer of 1926 when it and a group of surrounding buildings were either razed or moved, all in order to make way for an expansion of the adjacent C&A rail yard. In early August, workers with the Simpkins House Moving Co. placed the library on wide wheel trucks and rolled it to a new location on Seminary Avenue, where it became a part of the C&A Shops complex (it was torn down at a later date.) There was talk of reestablishing the library at a new location, but for reasons unknown no actions were taken on this front. Fenton, who had been in poor health for much of 1926, passed away in early January 1927. “She was a patient sufferer and won the sympathy of all by her cheerfulness and sunny smile, even in the darkest hours of her affliction,” read her obituary. As a member of Holy Trinity Catholic Church, she was laid to rest at St. Mary’s Cemetery on Bloomington’s far west side. The well-attended funeral included a large number of C&A employees. A decade earlier, back in August 1917, the C&A Library’s cherished piano, said to be one of the oldest in the Twin Cities, was carted off the premises. Although its years as a piano had come to an end, it would soon be back in the cozy library, after its conversion into a reading room table. “Librarian Margaret Fenton shed a few tears as the piano was dumped into the auto truck by John Curley and his force,” noted The Pantagraph at the time, “but when the piano returns, converted into a library table the amiable librarian will undoubtedly be all smiles, which will be nothing more than the usual for Miss Fenton.\"",

    "content": "Though it may seem hard to believe, horses remained an integral part of Corn Belt farms well into the 1930s. And although the tractor began making significant and rapid inroads in the latter half of the decade, “power farming” would not become ubiquitous until the post World War II years. That meant, generally speaking, that the last local barns built with work horses in mind date to the late 1930s or early 1940s. By then the emergence of the tractor and other sweeping changes in corn farming, coupled with the introduction of new building materials, gave rise to vastly different types of barns. The yawning gap between pre- and post-tractor barns is exemplified by the fact that some of the latter aren’t even called barns—instead these boxy, unadorned and utilitarian buildings carry the distinctly industrial identity of “machine shed.” Corn was mostly picked (or rather, “husked”) by hand and pitched into wagons pulled by horses through the Great Depression. Mechanical corn pickers were not common until the 1940s, with combines (machines that both picked and shelled corn) coming a little later. As horses and other draft animals were replaced by mechanical power, farmers turned away from general-purpose farming to specialization. With around one quarter of their acreage previously set aside for oats (raised for horse feed), as well as additional land no longer needed for pasture and hay, some farmers embraced intensive row crop production with corn and soybeans. Other farmers began small (by today’s standards) commercial livestock operations involving dairy or beef cattle, or hogs. Often all-purpose horse barns were modified into dairy or beef barns, or to hold other livestock. But with their low ceilings, built-in stalls, feed bins, tack rooms and other “rustic” features, old barns were ill-suited, even with extensive remodeling, to efficiently serve as machine sheds. The storage of loose hay in barns required cavernous second-story hay mows (or, more colloquially, “lofts”.) But the shift to baled hay often meant farmers abandoned the mow (frequently unable to support the additional weight of baled hay) for field or ground storage. In addition, the popularity of the “loafing” system, whereby cattle were no longer housed and fed in stalls but given more freedom to roam, contributed to the increasing obsolesce of traditional barn design. Instead, more and more livestock were housed in one-story, shed-like buildings that often doubled as machine storage. The Pantagraph often referred to these barn / machine shed hybrids as “utility barns” or even “utility buildings.” Some were framed in all-steel while others with laminated, pressure-treated wood poles. “Government and university agricultural experts alike confidently predicted [in the postwar years] that the general-purpose wood-frame barn, nostalgically, and at times sarcastically, referred to as ‘the big red barn,’ would be replaced by five million gleaming buildings made of steel, aluminum, and treated wood,” noted a 1995 essay on the history of Midwestern barns. Fortunately, Corn Belt farmers continued to build wood-frame barns (albeit now often with first-story concrete block walls), though not nearly in the numbers of the past. Throughout the 1940s, downstate farmers also modernized old barns or built new ones in order to comply with the state’s grade A milk law. In the fall of 1941, for example, E.S. Sloane constructed a model dairy barn on his farm southwest of Danvers. The barn, large enough to house 24 Jersey cows, included a concrete floor and finished walls. The dairy herd was kept in an insulated partition apart from the machinery and feed storage areas. The barn’s many “refinements,” noted The Pantagraph, included electric lights, an electric-powered milking apparatus and a radio to help farm manager D.L. McClure and other hired help pass the day. Despite the home front shortage of building materials during World War II, farmers, given the importance of food production in the Allied war effort, continued to construct new barns and other outbuildings. That said, they still had to jump through plenty of bureaucratic hoops. “Farmers,” announced a May 1942 advertisement for Parker Lumber of Bloomington. “If you need a new barn or [corn] crib see us. We can guide you in getting permission in compliance with the war-caused restrictions on building. Let’s talk it over.” In the summer of 1945, at war’s end, Paul Graf of rural Bloomington built a handsome 28 by 30 feet barn with a traditional second-story mow to accommodate his dozen or so cows. The walls were of concrete block, with Graf telling The Pantagraph that “it is almost impossible to get a good quality wood for buildings now.” Quonset-style barns proved especially popular after the war, since tens of thousands of these “huts” had been built for the military at home and overseas. Detroit-based Great Lakes Steel Corp., a leading Quonset manufacturer, had a number of authorized dealers in the area, including the R.J. Kuhn Co. of Danvers and Acme Roofing of Bloomington. The “Quonset 40” type barn was 40 feet wide with a pair of sliding doors and entryway large enough to accommodate most farm equipment then in use. It came in sections of 20 feet enabling farmers to build to their liking, whether 40 by 60 feet, 40 by 80, or larger. “The ‘Quonset 40’ is framed with steel and covered with steel to give you the sturdiest, most durable building ever produced for the farm,” declared an Acme Roofing advertisement for Quonsets in December 1945. “It is fire-safe, sag-proof, rot-proof, warp-proof—strong with the uniform strength of steel.” One advantage of curved or Quonset-shaped barns was the lack of crossbeams and other support—“not a brace for a bird to roost on overhead,” it was said. Curved barns made of wood with asphalt roofing were also popular. Lloyd Shifflet built one such barn in the spring of 1947 on the old Champion farm north of Towanda. One end housed stanchions and box stalls for eight cows, while the other served as a machine shed large enough to keep a four-row corn planter “under cover.” The modern postwar barn was perfectly realized in the steel-framed and steel-sided “utility barn” built in late 1949 on the Crumbaugh estate outside of LeRoy (see accompanying photograph). Farm operator M.J. Banner planned to use the 36 by 84 feet structure, which replaced a barn burned earlier in the year, for machinery (including a “self-propelled combine”) and hay storage, though he’d still have room enough for three “all-purpose” livestock box stalls.",

    "content": "One hundred years ago, New Year’s Eve 1919 brought hope for better days to come. After all, the nation had been deeply scarred by the twin horrors of World War I and the influenza pandemic. The “Great War” of 1914-1918 claimed more than 20 million lives, and as it neared its grimy, bloody end, the “Spanish flu” (1918-1920) then spread to nearly every corner of the globe, claiming in the process another 50 million or more souls. Although the Treaty of Versailles, signed on June 28, 1918, ended the state of war between Germany and the Allied Powers, it did not take effect until Jan. 10, 1920. In the interregnum, tens of thousands of American “doughboys” (as Uncle Sam’s soldiers were known) remained garrisoned in France and Germany to help maintain the peace and civil order. A week before the New Year, local residents got word that Julia Scott Vrooman had finally returned stateside after spending something like two years both entertaining U.S. troops in traumatized Europe and lending assistance to benumbed French civilians (she was born and raised at 701 E. Taylor St. in Bloomington, which is now the Vrooman Mansion bed and breakfast.) Vrooman became something of celebrity as she traveled across France and Germany with her self-styled jazz band. “Where the boys did not have musical instruments they made them out of frying pans and other camp utensils,” she said upon her return to Washington, D.C., where her husband Carl served as an assistant secretary in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. “It is surprising what a lot of music you can get out of string, stretched over a frying pan—if you adjust your ear to the music.” Also looming over the 1919-1920 holiday season was the Eighteenth Amendment and the ban on the importation, transportation, and sale of alcoholic beverages. Prohibition formally began on Jan. 17, 1920 when the Volstead Act—the federal ban’s enabling legislation—became the law of the land. The federal act, though, did not necessarily prohibit the consumption of alcohol, so many Americans stockpiled cases of beer, wine and hard liquor for the lean years to come. Although the local record is suspiciously quiet regarding well-lubricated area residents, there is no question that New Year’s Eve 1919 was a bittersweet “last call” for more than a few folks! In many ways, Central Illinois residents celebrated the New Year’s back then much like we do today. The sound era in motion pictures was a decade away, yet even this early in its history, the silver screen captured the nation’s imagination. As such, many area residents and families used the New Year’s holiday to catch a movie at one of the downtown movie houses. At the Irvin on East Jefferson Street—the city’s premier “popcorn palace”—it was Billie Burke in “Wanted: A Husband,” and the two-reel comedy “Back to Nature.” Meanwhile, the Castle Theatre showed “Piccadilly Jim” with Owen Moore and Zena Keefe; the Majestic had the Irish drama “Kathleen Mavourneen;” and at the Scenic on the 300 block of North Madison Street it was Harold Lockwood in “Shadows of Suspicion.” There was live stage entertainment on New Year’s Eve as well. At the Chatterton Opera House on East Market Street, theatergoers were promised a “riot of fun, a feast of music and a bewitching bevy of feminine beauty” in the George M. Cohan and Sam H. Harris production of “Going Up.” The musical was best known for its show-stopper “Tickle-Toe.” Much like today, “watch night” parties were held by young and old, rich and poor alike. The American Legion sponsored a dance at the National Guard armory in the warehouse district south of downtown. The Dornaus Orchestra—featuring one Dornaus after another on everything from viola to saxophone—provided the music. The Hills Hotel at the corner of Madison and Washington streets offered a six-course dinner, music by the Alador Orchestra and dancing until 1:00 a.m. Revelers paid $2.50 for the evening of entertainment (adjusted for inflation, that $2.50 would be the equivalent of $34 today.) As New Year’s Eve 1919 fell on a Wednesday—traditionally the prayer meeting night for houses of worship—a number of area churches also held watch parties up to, and beyond, the midnight hour. At Grace Methodist in Bloomington, the Rev. B.F. Shipp delivered a bit of year-end sermonizing before stepping aside so the church’s Epworth League (the Methodist young adult association) could take charge. The congregation then rang in the New Year with a prayer. The 1919-1920 holiday season also occurred during the First Red Scare, a time when the U.S. Department of Justice under Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer persecuted so-called political and labor radicals. The Palmer Raids, conducted in November 1919 and January 1920, sought to capture, arrest and deport leftist leaders, many of whom were Italian and Eastern European immigrants. As such, the New Year’s Day edition of The Pantagraph featured a front-page declaration by Attorney General Palmer in which he promised to wage “unflinching, persistent, aggressive warfare” against radicals and likeminded fellow travelers. “We have found,” he declared, “that the ‘red’ movement does not mean an attitude of protest against alleged defects in our present political and economic organization of society … It is not a movement of liberty loving persons, but distinctly a criminal and dishonest scheme.” The annual New Year’s dinner for the area’s less fortunate children was held at the YMCA building, then located at the southeast corner of East and Washington streets in downtown Bloomington. Grain and lumber merchant John Geltmacher started the tradition back in the mid-1890s. Although he passed away in 1904, he left behind funds to continue the holiday meal, which lasted into the mid-20th century. Geltmacher was also an anti-alcohol zealot, so the dinners were often prepared by the local Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, and the children had to sit through songs, skits and sermons on the evils of drinking. New Year’s Day 1920 ushered in a new decade. As such, enumerators were preparing to pound the pavement for the U.S. government’s decennial census—just like today! The nation’s 14th census began Jan. 5, 1920, and lasted one month. Those working to count Bloomington residents included Harry A. Slack, Mary Normile, Wilber Dillon Clapp and Ansel F. Stubblefield, among many others. A snowstorm resembling “one of those howling western blizzards” swept across Central Illinois during the height of New Year’s Eve revelry. “The year 1919 went out in a rage,” noted The Pantagraph. “A strong north wind sent the snow swirling and eddying about and conditions out of doors were anything but pleasant.” Perhaps not pleasant from the viewpoint of fuddy-duddy adults, certainly, but the snow was surely welcomed by those children with bright-and-shiny sleds under their family’s Christmas tree.",

    "content": "Fifty years ago this week, December 1968, fast-approaching Christmas and New Year’s afforded many Americans an opportunity to reflect back on one of the more frenzied and unnerving years in memory. It was a year of assassinations, student protests and race riots, remembered today for its widening generation gap and earthshaking political and social tumult. On March 31, President Lyndon Baines Johnson, burdened by an increasingly unpopular war in Southeast Asia, announced he would not seek reelection. Civil rights leader Martin Luther King was assassinated on Apr. 4, and presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy was shot and killed June 5. International events included the Soviet Union’s brutal invasion of Czechoslovakia (marking the end of the Prague Spring), and the Viet Cong’s Tet Offensive in South Vietnam, which helped turn American popular opinion against a war. Yet in the Twin Cities, the surrounding countryside and its small towns—the middle of Middle America, if you will, or the buckle of the Corn Belt—it was a rather typical Christmastime taken up with decorations, gift giving, acts of charity, family gatherings and worship services. Signs of normalcy were everywhere. In mid-December 1968, in a local pre-Christmas tradition, the Home Sweet Home Mission handed out 3,000 articles of winter clothing to 80 mothers and some 400 children. And a week or so later, Gerald Nafziger, who lived on the 1200 block of Gettysburg Drive in Bloomington, received the top overall prize in the 35th annual Bloomington-Normal Christmas lighting contest, sponsored by the Jaycees and Illinois Power Co. That’s not to say change wasn’t in the air. The opening in February 1967 of Eastland Shopping Center represented a grievous blow to downtown Bloomington as the region’s historic retail center. Both Sears, Roebuck and Co. and J.C. Penney closed their downtown stores and reopened at Eastland as mall anchors. The local department store W.H. Roland, a fixture on the north side of the courthouse square, also moved to Eastland, though it kept its downtown location until 1982 (the Eastland store then closed in 1988.) Back in 1968, downtown Bloomington was still home to Montgomery Ward, which wouldn’t leave until 1980 when College Hills Mall opened in Normal. Two other locally owned department stores also remained downtown, Livingston’s and Klemm’s (they would close for good in January 1979 and November 1981 respectively.) All things considered—this being 1968 and all—things were still pretty quiet on the Illinois State and Illinois Wesleyan campuses. In fact, it wasn’t until the spring of 1970, with President Richard Nixon’s announcement that he was sending U.S. troops into Cambodia, and the subsequent killing of four protesters at Kent State University by Ohio National Guardsmen, that student unrest, marches and street clashes roiled the local campuses. The Vietnam War, of course, was never far away in 1968. Nine area General Telephone Co. employees serving in the military in Vietnam and Thailand, for example, were given free ten-minute phone calls back home for the holidays. Included were Spec. 4 Tadeo Rodriquez of Bloomington, who before being called overseas was a custodian in the Bloomington district office, and Spec. Donald L. Bane of Ellsworth, who was a storekeeper in the same building. Eastland, celebrating its second holiday season since its opening, was crowded with shoppers, its fortunes on the rise as downtown’s fell. Penney’s had double knit acetate Nehru jackets in navy for $10, and creamy pastel bulky cardigans for $8. The once-mighty national retailer also had Teflon-coated automatic corn poppers featuring a glass dome that doubled as a serving bowl for $10.99, or a combination electric can opener / knife sharpener for $17.99. “Like it? Charge it!” was Penney’s advice to holiday shoppers. In an age before globalization and low-cost overseas manufacturing, many consumer goods were appreciably more expensive than they are today, especially when adjusting for inflation. One dollar in 1968, it should be noted, would be worth about $7.10 today. Miller Music Co. on North Main Street in downtown Bloomington advertised Wollensak “economy-priced” handheld tape recorders for $54.95. That comes to $390 in 2018 dollars! Sears offered its 23-inch (diagonally measured) Silvertone-brand console color TV, said to be the largest color screen on the market, for $579.88 (or more than $4,100 in inflation-adjusted 2018 dollars.) Roland’s, with stores both downtown and Eastland mall, still set the standard for elegance and fashion in the Twin Cities. “Let us help you wrap up your gift shopping in a way to please all femininity,” promised Roland’s two days before Christmas, “beautiful lingerie, blouses, cosmetics, dresses, coats, furs, gloves, shoes, handbags, gifts for the home, slacks, sweaters ...” Biasi’s, a longtime locally owned drug store on the east side of the courthouse square, sold Remington, Sunbeam and Schick ladies electric shavers from $9.95 to $21.45. Hildebrandt Drug Store in uptown Normal advertised Hai Karate cologne, $1.50 to $1.75 a bottle, and Parker brand gift pens, $1.98 to $5.90. Then as now, some folks and families made moviegoing on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day a tradition. At the long-gone Irvin Theater on East Jefferson Street downtown, it was “Yellow Submarine,” the psychedelic animated adventure starring the Beatles. The Castle had “Bullitt” with that embodiment of Sixties cool, Steve McQueen, while the Normal offered the decidedly un-cool “double fun show” of Doris Day in “With Six You Get Eggroll” and Debbie Reynolds in “How Sweet It Is!” For many Americans, a year full of menace and darkness ended in the wonder and optimism of the Apollo 8 mission, as NASA’s three-astronaut crew—Frank Borman, James Lovell and William Anders—piloted the first manned spacecraft to reach the moon. “The Apollo 8 astronauts swept today into orbit around the moon,” announced the front page of the Dec. 24 Pantagraph, “and as they gazed back at their troubled home planet, a quarter-million miles away, flight commander Frank Borman offered a Christmastime prayer of peace.” It was a truly wondrous event, witnessed by hundreds of millions across the globe. The mission is best known today for the iconic “Earthrise” photograph taken by William Anders as the crew readied for its fourth orbit of the moon. It shows the earth beyond the moon, an improbably delicate but beautiful blue marble in the black void. “Thank you Apollo 8,” one stranger wrote to Borman. “You saved 1968.”",

    "content": "World War II still loomed large over American life during the Halloween season of 1945. The surrender of Japan marking the war’s end had come on Aug. 15, a short 2 1/2 months earlier. The magnitude of the Second World War was such that Central Illinois residents were still learning the tragic fate of loved ones who fought overseas. The Rev. William B. Weaver of North Danvers Mennonite Church, for instance, received a letter dated Oct. 17 from his daughter Emma informing him that her husband and his son-in-law, Robert Wheeler of Carlock, was killed in action on March 28 during the prelude to the U.S. invasion of Okinawa. In the fall of 1945, the pages of The Pantagraph were also filled with one long list after another of soldiers heading back to Central Illinois and home. On Oct. 30, those discharged from Ft. Sheridan north of Chicago and Camp Grant outside of Rockford included Corp. Harry R. Allen from the Illinois Soldier’s and Sailor’s Children’s School in Normal; Mildred M. Veatch of Bloomington, a technician with the Women’s Army Corps (WAC); and S. Sgt. LaVerne Kent of Gridley. Four days before Halloween, Illinois State Normal University held its homecoming parade, football game and dance. Facing the Redbirds on the gridiron were the Huskies of Northern Illinois State Teachers College (now NIU) in DeKalb. Ceremonies before the game include the unveiling of a Gold Star memorial recognizing 75 former ISNU students killed in the recently ended war (see accompanying photograph.) Also honored were some 2,500 current and former ISNU students then serving in the Armed Forces. But not everyone’s attention was on the recently concluded war and its enormities, unfathomable losses and moral complexities. On Oct. 8, Bloomington Police Chief Clyde Hibbens “opened the annual police drive against pre-Halloween pranksters” by requesting all auxiliary officers participate in the “apprehension of youthful vandals.” Halloween was once a far more mischievous holiday that it is today (In fact, “soap or eats!” was a common trick-or-treat greeting.) In 1945, to cite a representative example, vandals removed stop signs from city street corners, causing two traffic accidents. “These signs,” an angry Bloomington Traffic Sgt. Walter C. Lockenvitz said at the time, “are being torn down faster than we can replace them.” Community leaders worried that the destruction of property was especially wasteful given wartime shortages and rationing still in effect. “Wanton vandalism is unusually serious this year,” read a Pantagraph editorial during the 1945 Halloween season. “Things ruined in a misguided fit of revelry are all but irreplaceable. Even soap used on screens and windows is scarce.” “There are plenty of ways of having harmless fun,” continued the editorial.” Use your brains and energy in devising some new ones. But don’t make conditions worse during the reconversion period by careless destruction.” The Pantagraph wasn’t going to get an argument from 2nd Ward Alderman Lawrence Turpin, that’s for sure. “For normal kids Halloween is a time for good fun,” declared Turpin, “but their good times are spoiled by a few overgrown morons who have the mentality of children and don’t know how to act.” The end of World War II also meant the end of the unprecedented military buildup and the slow and painful return to an economy geared more toward the civilian market. By late Oct., Sears Roebuck and Co. had announced the acquisition of 80 train car loads of surplus U.S. Army ammunition boxes. “Uncle Sam doesn’t need ’em,” it was said. These ammunition boxes were sold for 29 cents each or four for $1. The downtown Bloomington Sears was at 312 N. Center St. (the building now occupied by Fox & Hound Day Spa and other businesses.) Suggested uses for the olive-green, heavy gauge steel containers ranged from the safekeeping of valuable family papers to fishing tackle boxes. Cities Service Oil Co. on Croxton Avenue in Bloomington sold surplus insecticide used to combat mosquito-borne disease in the Pacific Theater. The product came in 16 oz. gas-filled cylinders—“aer-o-sol bombs,” they were called—designed to release a “fog-like spray” containing 3 percent DDT. If that’s wasn’t scary enough to modern sensibilities, the insecticide—“effective against flies, mosquitoes, gnats, ants, cockroaches, bedbugs, moths, silver fish, spiders and other biting insects”—was meant for indoor use. The federal government was also beginning to relax wartime restrictions on rationed food staples and raw materials—everything from butter to rubber tires. With regards to the former, on Nov. 1, 1945, the U.S. Department of Agriculture released 100 million pounds of butter to consumers, though it also ended subsidies and price controls that were expected to increase its cost by 5 cents a pound. Trick-or-treating wasn’t as organized or widespread as it is today, though school-sponsored children’s parties and parades were as common then as now. In Cooksville, a small village east of Normal, the high school held its Halloween party at the community hall. The end of World War II ushered in a massive wave of school consolidation across the Corn Belt. More than 200 one-room schools were closed for good in McLean County alone in the latter half of the 1940s. At the same time, the county’s smallest communities were losing their high schools. Cooksville, for example, closed its high school in 1949. Back on Halloween 1945, at the state-operated Illinois Soldier’s and Sailor’s Children’s School in north Normal, kindergartners through fifth graders participated in a masquerade and played carnival games, earning points at the various booths. Treats included “doughnuts, cookies and orange drink.” Sixth, seventh and eighth graders held a party at the school’s gymnasium, entry into which required passing through a maze populated with “witches, skeletons and chicken feet.” Meanwhile, on Bloomington’s west side, some 240 children and adults representing the Western Avenue Community Center gathered at O’Neil Park for the center’s annual Halloween party, which included a bonfire, costume parade, games and apples and candy. But the war’s horrors could not be so easily forgotten. The military tribunals in Nuremberg, Germany seeking justice against Nazi leadership got underway less than three week weeks later, on Nov. 20.",

    "content": "One of the more beloved local figures from Bloomington’s rich past is Baby Bliss, the city’s resident “fat man” who more than a century ago gained considerable fame here and abroad popularizing the bicycle. Described as a “veritable mountain of flesh” and someone “overburdened with a surplus of avoirdupois” (an archaic term for bodily heft), Bliss was said to have weighed in excess of 500 pounds much of his adult life, and at one point tipped the scales at 565 pounds. Beloved or not, the life of this gentle giant was marked by tragedy. Bliss became a celebrity by drawing attention to his weight, often in less than edifying—if not humiliating—ways. He also struggled with mental illness, spending time institutionalized in a series of state hospitals. Leonard H. “Baby” Bliss was born May 4, 1865 in Blue Mound Township, a rural stretch of McLean County east of Normal. He weighed 10 or 12 pounds at birth (accounts vary), and his parents, Elijah and Lucy Harmon Bliss, were “ordinarily proportioned,” both in height and weight. His brother too was of average size. By the age of 11, though, Leonard (the nickname “Baby” would come later, courtesy of Pantagraph editor William McCambridge) was 6 feet tall and weighed between 180 and 190 pounds. At 17 he reached his full height, 6 feet 4 inches, and weighed 280 pounds. Two years later, at the age 19, he topped 350 pounds. Bliss’ parents moved to Bloomington in 1884 and he spent most of his adult life in the city. In 1890, “Baby,” already a well-known local figure given his disproportionate size, was hired as a traveling salesman for Chisholm-Gray Co., a Bloomington commission house. In this role he sold a specially made cigar by Fred Smith of Bloomington called “Our Baby,” with Bliss’ own likeness appearing on each box. That spring, in late April 1890, Bliss suffered one of his reoccurring mental breakdowns. Judge Colostin Myers ordered him sent to the Illinois Eastern Hospital for the Insane in Kankakee (renamed the Kankakee State Hospital in 1910). “Mr. Bliss is known and liked by all, men, women and children … and it is hoped by his friends that his insanity may be of short duration,” noted The Pantagraph. However, less than three years later, he was back at the Kankakee hospital. Dissipation, a condition caused by intemperate living, especially heavy drinking, was said to be the cause of this latest bout of insanity. Later speculation held that his “mental derangement” was brought on by digestive problems. Although Bliss neither traveled with a circus nor appeared in a circus sideshow, he participated in his share of humiliating stunts and contests common to 19th and early 20th century American society which was both fascinated and repulsed by “freaks” of nature in human form. In late July 1893, for instance, a 450-pound Bliss and the 40-pound African-American dwarf John Curtis faced each other in a foot race at the old east side fairgrounds, which encompassed an area that today is bounded by Country Club Place, Mercer and Oakland avenues, and Vale Street. The winner got $5 and the runner-up a watermelon. Bliss’ big break came in 1895 when he began working for a Chicago firm that produced a well-engineered, high-end bicycle called the American. The company taught Bliss to master the two-wheeled contraptions, which were all the rage in the late 19th century, and then use his prowess as a supersized cyclist to sell their product. The sales pitch was obvious: If Baby Bliss can ride an American bicycle … you can too! Bliss sometimes appeared with Jimmy “Midget” Michael, the Welsh world cycling champion who stood 5 feet 1 1/2 inches. During the spring 1896 cycling season Bliss was an attraction at exhibitions in Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Detroit and elsewhere. In June of that year he traveled to Europe, demonstrating American model bicycles to crowds in London, Glasgow, Belfast, Stockholm, Berlin, Vienna and elsewhere. Unfortunately, by late summer 1897 the American bicycle company had gone belly up and Bliss was out of a job. Sometime afterward he began appearing at county and state fairs, amusement parks and the like, billing himself as “The Heaviest Man in the World.” In this role his promotional material falsely claimed he weighed an improbable 740 pounds. In late March 1910, near the end of a two-month stay at Peoria State Hospital in Bartonville after another breakdown, Baby Bliss signed a contract to become “captain” of the Waterloo, Ia.-based Fat Men’s Amusement Co. baseball club. This misguided venture represents Bliss’ last official appearances as a celebrity fat man. The club failed to draw crowds of sufficient size to pay expenses, and before summer’s end the team folded. By September Bliss was one of a dozen players suing management for back pay. When he wasn’t on the road, Bliss lived at his parent’s place on the 1200 block of East Clay Street (now Oakland Avenue). Leonard “Baby” Bliss’ death at the age of 46 was a tragic one. In early January 1912, after he had gone missing several days during a sharp cold snap, a neighbor decided to check on the house. Bliss’ father had died more than a decade earlier and his ailing and aged mother was at Brokaw Hospital, so he was living alone at the time. There, from the kitchen window, the neighbor could see Bliss, sitting in his specially made oversized blue chair next to a gas stove, “his head titled back, cold in death.” Police officers were called to the scene and after gaining entry they found Bliss frozen solid and the smell of natural gas in the air. Bliss, dressed in a flannel night robe, had been dead for a day or two. Although there were whispers of suicide, those that knew him best disputed such talk. Instead, despite all apparent evidence, there was general consensus that he had awakened a night or two earlier with the intention of warming himself by the stove, and while preparing to do so must have accidentally knocked open two of the stove’s jets and was soon overcome by gas. On Jan. 5, McLean County Coroner James Hare held an inquest over Bliss’ thawed body. After hearing the evidence, the coroner’s jury returned a verdict of death from accidental asphyxiation. Despite temperatures that were said to dip nearly 20 degrees below zero, some 300 people attended Bliss’ funeral service. Among those in attendance was Edward S. Marcus, a rival “fat man” bicyclist from Chicago. The casket, shipped from Chicago, was the largest ever received by a local undertaker. The story of the casket and its extraordinary dimensions appeared in newspapers across the nation. Even in death, Bliss couldn’t escape the lurid and leering public.",

    "content": "“Miss Colby was a most unusual person,” noted Helen Marshall in her centennial history of Illinois State Normal University. “She was an ardent feminist. Regardless of fashion she always had pockets in her skirts, insisting that pockets were as useful to women as to men.” For nearly four decades, from 1892 to the early 1930s, Professor June Rose Colby taught literature, grammar and composition on the Normal campus, helping to instill a love of the written word in two generations of teachers-in-training. Unconventional for her times, there was no doubting her devotion to classroom instruction. “She entered into the teaching of Shakespeare with her whole soul,” added Marshall in her 1956 university history. “No one would ever forget the way she read poetry.” Born in 1856 in Cherry Valley, Ohio, Colby’s early education came on the family’s dairy farm. “My mother was a born teacher,” she once recalled. “I used to stand by the cheese vat and get a geography lesson while she broke up the curd into geographical shapes.” The Colby family eventually moved to Ann Arbor, Mich., apparently so several children could attend the University of Michigan. And sure enough, June Rose went on to earn a four-year A.B. (bachelor’s) degree and an A.M. (master’s) degree, both from Michigan. She intended to teach Latin and Greek, but found herself increasingly influenced by English poet and critic Matthew Arnold, and his philosophy that “literature is a criticism of life.” Accordingly, Colby overhauled her studies to concentrate on English literature and writing. “I realized that if I wanted to get at people through what I taught,” she said, “it would have to be in my own language.” The whip-smart Colby then became the first (or one of the first) women to receive a Ph.D. from the University of Michigan. Even so, she found herself unable to secure a college position, and instead taught public high school in Peoria for some six years. Finally, in 1892, she received and accepted an offer from ISNU, becoming the third woman in the school’s history to attain the rank of professorship. As Dr. John B. Freed observed in his definitive history of ISU, Colby’s academic credentials were “more impressive in fact than those of most of her male colleagues.” Her longtime home was on the north edge of campus at 302 W. Mulberry St. This block is now the stretch of green space to the east of Milner Library along West College Avenue. She never married nor had children. Colby was small in stature, so much so that she had a special classroom chair made for her. The 11-inch seat was only 19 inches off the floor, though the chair also featured an outsized back so she could rest her head while deep in thought. Women didn’t gain the constitutional right to ballot box until passage of the 19th amendment in 1920. Colby was one of the best known suffragists in Twin Cities, and her home often served as the meeting place for the Normal Equal Suffrage Association. She was also an unabashed supporter of an early version of the Equal Rights Amendment. Of late, there has been renewed attention on women educators such as Colby who, while appearing to adhere to the norms and strictures of late 19th and early 20th century pedagogy, were also “silent” academic feminists who employed “discreet” yet “wholly subversive” rhetorical strategies to undermine the patriarchal order of higher education. Be that as it may, Colby could be delightfully unpredictable. During Word War I, a Red Cross auxiliary was organized on the campus. “Miss Colby, who normally prided herself on not being domestic,” related Helen Marshall, “urged girls and faculty women to join the unit and spend their spare time sewing, making surgical dressings, and rolling bandages in the faculty women’s cloakroom.” In the spring of 1940, The Pantagraph’s Catherine Lane paid a visit to the 83-year-old Colby at her Mulberry Street home. Sitting in her specially made chair, the “delicate little Miss J. Rose Colby” was charming, witty, insightful and outspoken, as her gray eyes twinkled mischievously throughout the interview. Having retired nine years earlier, Colby spoke of the many and deep connections she made with faculty members and students alike, as well as the joys of the classroom. “Oh, I loved it!” she exclaimed. Retirement, though, had its rewards, perhaps none greater than newfound time for reading. “For a year and a half after she retired from teaching,” read the 1940 Pantagraph profile, “Miss Colby returned to her girlhood love of the classics and read Latin, then she took up Greek again and read quite a lot of Xenophon and Plato.” Colby said her leading literary lights were Homer, Shakespeare, Emerson and Matthew Arnold. On the other hand, the professor remained unimpressed with contemporary American fiction. “I haven’t read Gone with the Wind; don’t think I ever shall,” she declared. Colby interrupted The Pantagraph’s Lane when the reporter asked about the future of women in the teaching profession. “Don’t say teachers, say all women,” she interjected. “The position of women is still insecure and will be until the Equal Rights Amendment is passed to protect them against discrimination.” Even though she struggled with health problems, Colby remained buoyant. “I used to be irritated with Emerson because I felt he overlooked the unpleasant side of life,” she said, “but I am more optimistic now than when I was a girl.” June Rose Colby passed away at her Mulberry Street home on May 11, 1941, fifteen months after her interview with Catherine Lane. The Pantagraph eulogized her as a “citizen at large of the whole world of thought.” She was laid to rest at what is today Evergreen Memorial Cemetery. The Dr. Jo Ann Rayfield Archives at ISU holds the June Rose Colby Papers, which include many of her academic writings, teaching notes, poems, correspondence, photographs and other fascinating items that speak to her life and career. In 1960, ISU opened Hamilton-Whitten, two linked 10-story residence halls. Two years later, two nearly identical halls, Atkin-Colby, were added to the complex that included Feeney Dining Center. The five buildings were named for women with connections to the early decades of university—Alma Mary Hamilton, Jennie A. Whitten, Mae Warren Feeney, Edith Irene Atkin and June Rose Colby. This residential hall complex, one of the finest local examples of International Style modernism, fell to the wrecking ball in 2016. Certainly there must be some planned or proposed ISU building that could carry again the name of Professor June Rose Colby.",

    "content": "This past week marked the 100th anniversary of the American entry into World War I, though for the other main combatants the unprecedented slaughter was nearing its third year. On May 7, 1917, one month and one day after the U.S. declared war on Germany, four brothers from the large Burger family entered the Bloomington recruiting station and enlisted in the U.S. Army. The four, Lloyd, age 27; Claude, 24; Ollie, 22; and Dewey, 18, were sons of Isaac and Mary (Clem) Burger. The family lived not far from the Village of McLean in southwestern McLean County. Dewy Burger was killed in France, while Lloyd, Claude and Ollie all made it safely home. Remarkably, there were several other families in McLean County with four sons in uniform during the war. In Bloomington there were at least four such families, including the Garbes of West Walnut Street, with sons Edward, Herman, Charles and Arthur; and the Watkins of East Chestnut Street, with sons Ferre, Warren, Paul and Harold. All eight survived the war. Madison and Marietta Busby of Chenoa, though, had five sons in the service, which is believed the most in McLean County. Two Busby boys—Robert with the 108th Ammunition Train and Richard with the signal corps—saw their fair share of action overseas, though both survived. Others, including Dewey Burger, were not so fortunate. Burger had three sisters and was the youngest of eight brothers (Arch, Thomas, Isaac and Richard were the four who did not jointly enlist). Several days after signing up to fight, Dewey, Lloyd, Claude and Ollie were sent to Jefferson Barracks south of St. Louis. From there Dewey trained in El Paso, Tex. (likely Fort Bliss), and after three weeks was sent to New York City to board a troopship. He arrived in France Jun. 28, a mere month-and-a-half after his enlistment. Burger served with Co. E, 16th Infantry, 1st Division, and was killed in action at Soissons, France, on Jul. 19, 1918, though the details of his death are few. He was buried in a nearby marked grave. The abattoir of the Western Front churned out several hundred thousand American casualties—the dead, dying, wounded and missing—and given the resultant bureaucratic chaos, the War Department did not inform Isaac and Mary Burger of their son’s death until Aug. 10. Dewey wrote often from the front lines, and so his parents were not aware that they were receiving letters from a dead son. His final letter, dated Jul. 9, ten days before his death, arrived at the Burger home on Aug. 8, two days before they learned the awful news. Dewey Burger was not forgotten, and today the American Legion post in McLean carries his name. In late February 1920, two-and-a-half years after the Armistice marking the war’s end, veterans from the Village of McLean and Mount Hope and Funks Grove townships began organizing an American Legion post, which would soon take the formal name of Burger-Benedict Post 573. Ernest Benedict, the post’s other namesake, enlisted May 9, 1917, two days after the Burger brothers. Dewey and Earnest were first cousins, their mothers being sisters. Benedict was sent to France that September, and served as a corporal in the 23rd Infantry. He too frequently wrote his parents, George and Alice (Clem) Benedict. The Pantagraph reprinted one of his letters on Jun. 17, 1918. “I have been at the front for quite awhile,” Ernest wrote. “Am sure doing my bit for Uncle Sam and all. Will not stop till it is all over, though I would like to see my loved ones. Don’t worry, mother, about me, for I will be home some sweet day.” He was killed in early July, several weeks after the letter appeared in this newspaper, during the buildup to the Battle of Chateau-Thierry. More than 170 servicemen from McLean County died in the “World War” (as WW I was known before WW II). Many local American Legion posts assumed the names of young men killed in action during World War I. Anchor’s post 164, for example, was named for Erwin Martensen; Bellflower’s post 202 for Earl Grant; Bloomington’s post 56 for Louis E. Davis; Colfax post 653 for Bernard Francis Davis and Albert Kerber; and LeRoy’s post 79 for Ruel Neal. Although more than 116,000 Americans were killed in the war, that total—as horrifying as it is—pales in comparison to the losses suffered by the British and those fighting for king and country. Three English families, the Smiths, the Souls and the Beecheys, had five sons killed in the war. And a rural Australian couple, Frederick and Maggie Smith, lost six of their seven sons. During World War II, the deaths of the five Sullivan brothers from Waterloo, Iowa, and the four Borgstrom brothers from Thatcher, Utah, led to the implementation of a Sole Survivor Policy. This Department of Defense Directive protects someone from the draft or combat duty if they’ve lost a family member to military service. In the spring of 1921, Dewey Burger’s remains were exhumed and brought back to the states on a transatlantic steamer. He was one of tens of thousands of American dead returned home in the years after the war. On May 19, he was laid to rest one final time at McLean Cemetery, which is located west of the Village of McLean. Two months later, Ernest Benedict’s remains likewise returned home, and on Jul. 24, he too was reinterred at McLean Cemetery. Benedict’s pallbearers included Lloyd, Claude and Ollie Burger. According to the official history of McLean County in World War I, the Dec. 1, 1917, opening of the Mount Hope Township Hall in downtown McLean presented one of the most memorable scenes of the entire home front effort. The highpoint of the civic gathering was the presentation of service flags by the Rev. Edgar D. Jones of First Christian Church, Bloomington. Local families received a flag if they had someone serving in the military, with the number of stars on the flag representing the number of family members in uniform. “During the presentation eyes of men and women all over the house brimmed with tears, and sobs were even audible,” reported The Pantagraph. “When flags bearing two stars and then three stars were shown the applause grew in volume, and when Rev. Mr. Jones silently held up one bearing four stars [for the Burgers] the crowd was divided into those who cheered and those who wept.”",

    "content": "The post-World War II era marked a dramatic evolution—if not revolution—in the design of school buildings. In Bloomington, Oakland Elementary School at 1605 East Oakland Ave. is an early exemplar of this movement in school architecture. Opened in October 1951, its low-slung, glassy “ultra-modern” (for its day) look stood in stark contrast to the district’s older buildings. “School was never like this!” marveled The Pantagraph at the time. “The new Oakland School … represents a departure from the standard school and incorporates many new ideas for better teaching and learning.” At its most uninspiring or institutional, the “standard school” model of the prewar years consisted of a two- or three-story boxy brick building saddled with a rigid floor plan. It’s hard for us today to appreciate the radical look new schools such as Oakland presented to ordinary folks in the early 1950s. Oakland School is of further interest due to its many similarities to an architectural landmark—Crow Island School in the northern Chicago suburb of Winnetka. Built in 1940, this school was as a collaborative project between architects Lawrence Perkins of Chicago. and the father-son team of Eliel and Eero Saarinen (the latter of St. Louis Arch fame). A decade later, Perkins would play a role in the design of Oakland School, a Crow Island look-alike right here in Bloomington. Crow Island School’s many innovations included classrooms scaled to kindergarteners and elementary students, in which windows, light switches, drinking fountains, and blackboards were placed at child level. Each “home-like” room also contained its own child-size washroom and sink for art projects and other activities. Furniture was also scaled to tiny folk, and could be moved around depending on the pedagogical circumstances, as opposed to prewar classroom setups with measured rows of installed desks. The Bloomington school followed suit on these and other Perkins-Saarinen design elements, including large built-in glass display cases at the entrance of each classroom that doubled as a window, bringing the natural light of the classrooms into the hallway. The finished Oakland School, with its emphasis on “long, low lines and plenty of light and air,” featured a sleek, sunlit lobby that also served as a lounge; an all-purpose room used both as a gymnasium and auditorium; and two wings, one with six classrooms for first through six graders, and the other for kindergarteners. The exteriors of both Crow Island and Oakland feature many International-style hallmarks, including a generally flat roof and windows with tiered, rectangular panes of glass. Furthermore, the dominant architectural element of both schools is a slender, rectangular brick “chimney” towering well above the school, serving to balance the building’s dominant horizontal lines. In the post-war years, new schools were being built outside the grid of older city neighborhoods and into more suburban-like settings, and thus had breathing room for a more sprawling footprint and “green” (as opposed to concrete) playgrounds. Both Crow Island and Oakland were also designed with their natural surroundings in mind; in the case of Oakland, a relatively undeveloped 11-acre site interspersed with a fair number of trees. Classrooms in both schools included doors to the outside so teachers could better incorporate the natural world into their curriculum. Oakland School cost Bloomington taxpayers $212,000 (or around $2 million in 2017 dollars, adjusted for inflation). Design and construction costs were paid from a bond issue approved by district voters in 1945. Around that same time the district retained Crow Island architect Lawrence Perkins and his partner Philip Will to survey the building needs of the district. Thus Oakland School’s final design was clearly a collaboration of sorts between Perkins and Will of Chicago and the Bloomington firm of Edgar E. Lundeen and Dean F. Hilfinger. The local architects also brought into the project visionary modernist A. Richard Williams, a professor of architecture at the University of Illinois who grew up in the Twin Cities. Williams worked with Lundeen and Hilfinger on a number of projects, including the 1957 Bloomington Federal Savings and Loan Association building (now known as the Government Center) at the corner of East and Washington streets in downtown Bloomington. In the end, it was the three downstate guys who received final credit as Oakland’s architects. Oakland was the first of several postwar grade schools built during the long tenure (1944-1965) of Superintendent George Wells, the other two being Centennial in 1957 (now part of Bloomington Junior High) and Stevenson. To further accommodate the baby boom generation, additions were made to Sheridan and Washington schools; an entire new school was built next to the old Irving; and a new high school opened in 1959. Oakland School, obviously, is named for Oakland Avenue, beating out two other proposed names—Bishop, for longtime school board secretary Mattie Bishop, and Stableton, for J.K. Stableton, a former district superintendant. Since its opening, Oakland School has more than doubled its footprint by adding two more classroom wings, a gymnasium, and more. Notwithstanding the many changes, the original 1951 part of the building, including the entryway, main classroom wing and all-purpose room, still maintain much of the Perkins / Saarinen / Williams modernist vision. The lobby looks much like it did in 1951, though the wood-burning fireplace is now electric. And there are other pleasant surprises, such as the continued use of the classroom display cases. In 1956, a poll in the influential periodical Architectural Record listed Crow Island as the most significant school building in the past 100 years of American architecture. Among all buildings, school or otherwise, it polled twelfth. And in 1989, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Perhaps it’s now Oakland School’s turn for some well-deserved recognition.",

    "content": "McLean County farmland has always had a relatively high rate of tenancy—from the earliest years of the county’s establishment to the present. One of the more remarkable landowner-tenant relationships in county history was that of U.S. Vice President Charles W. Fairbanks and African-American tenant farmer Jesse Robert Ward. Fairbanks, a U.S. senator from Indiana when he became Theodore Roosevelt’s running mate in the 1904 presidential election, owned 2,000-plus acres in Bellflower Township, in the McLean County’s southeastern corner. Ward was born into slavery in 1857 in Grand Lake, Arkansas. After being freed, he made his way to Bellflower Township where he found a new life as one of Fairbanks’ tenant farmers. On a farmstead three miles east of the Village of Bellflower, Jesse and his wife Mary raised twelve children to adulthood—four daughters and eight sons. Despite the enormous chasm of opportunities and life experiences between the white privileged politician and the black tenant farmer, the two men and their families developed an abiding respect and friendship toward each other. In fact, Fairbanks, who maintained a summer home several miles south of the Bellflower, was said to be a frequent visitor to the Ward home. By 1896, the year Fairbanks vaulted into national prominence after delivering the keynote address at the Republican National Convention, he and his two brothers, William D. and Luther N., owned 2,300 acres in McLean County; another 300 or so acres in adjacent DeWitt and Piatt counties; as well as expansive holdings elsewhere in Illinois in Indiana. Jesse Ward, notwithstanding his humble beginnings, maintained one of the larger private libraries in this stretch of Central Illinois. “If you want something, learn how to make it yourself,” was one of “Father” Wards’ practical life-lessons. Accordingly, several Ward sons were credited with the owning and operating the first steam engine among their neighbors. The Wards also introduced the area’s first riding plow, with local farm folk referring to the new-fangled, byzantine-looking implement as a “monstrosity.” Three Ward boys graduated from the Berry School of Horsemanship in Pleasant Hill, Ohio. And much like steam power, several brothers became adept at harnessing electricity. “Their carbide light system was not so good but their Delco light plant was so successful and the boys studied so much, that they were electricians and wired houses all over Central Illinois,” noted a profile of Luther Ward, one of Jesse’s sons. Much like the two family patriarchs, the Fairbanks and Ward children were friends. One story holds that when Charles Fairbanks’ son Warren was preparing to attend law school, efforts were made to have Ward’s eldest son Henry accompany him and perhaps earn a law degree as well. “Mother” Ward put a stop to those plans, citing several Bible passages chapter and verse, such as Luke 11:52: “Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.” Mary Ward, according to a history of Piatt County, declared that, “none of her children should be standing in the courtroom defending the law when they should be defending righteousness.” Beautiful Bellflower Township is host of this year’s Barn Keepers self-guided Barn Tour, Sat., Sept. 8. Tickets, $20 per carload, $15 for Barn Keepers members, are available that day at the Bellflower Community Center, 9 am to 2 pm. Tour participants are free to visit any of the eleven featured farmsteads and barns in any order and pace of their own choosing. The ticket price includes a booklet featuring a map to find one’s way around the township and write-ups on each stop—the history of each barn and the family that farms their today. There are also brief historical sketches on Charles Fairbanks and the Ward family. The Barn Tour, a popular early autumn tradition now in its thirteenth year, is sponsored by Barn Keepers, a McLean County-based not-for-profit group dedicated to the preservation and restoration of area barns. Back in 1913, more than 2,000 acres of Charles Fairbanks’ McLean County land, including tracts of 367 and 341 acres, were transferred to his son Richard M. The following year, 1914, bothers Joe and Jesse, Jr. Ward helped lead Bellflower High School to the McLean County Basketball Tournament title. Six years later, in 1920, Joe attended Illinois State Normal University, becoming the first African American on the school’s basketball team. He also earned respect throughout Central Illinois as a high school sports official, a role he embraced for a quarter century or longer Charles Fairbanks died in 1918, but the Wards continued to live on and farm Fairbanks estate land. By 1927, the family was responsible for 1,200 acres. ”They are welcome anywhere they are known,” noted The Pantagraph at the time. “Neighbors like to exchange work with them. They expect little and give generously of their time and work.” On January 2, 1951, a tragic farmhouse fire at the Ward place took the lives of one of Jesse’s son Joe and Joe’s sister Cora. It’s believed Luther G. Ward was the last of the immediate family to live in the Bellflower area. He passed away in the fall of 1975 at a hospital in nearby Gibson City. Fairbanks land was sold off in stages in the latter half of the 20th century. In late September 1962, for instance, George Holder of Bloomington and Walter Jiles of LeRoy purchased 673 acres for $343,786 from Peoples Bank of Bloomington, which was acting as trustee for the late Mary A. Fairbanks, daughter of the vice president. On Sept. 22, 1907, during his vice presidency, Fairbanks (the namesake of the Alaskan city, by the way), visited Bloomington for the laying of the cornerstone for the YMCA building once located at the southeast corner of East and Washington streets (today, the site is a municipal surface parking lot). “Mr. Fairbanks is not the ‘iceberg’ the cartoonists and paragraphers [that is, reporters] of the country have made the people believe him,” observed The Pantagraph. “He appears energetic, virile, full-blooded—the very opposite of the ‘apostle of coldness.’” Although a stalwart Republican paper, The Pantagraph couldn’t help but have some light-hearted fun at the expense of the vice president. “Mr. Fairbanks is also somewhat bald-headed and carefully combs what hair the ravaging tooth of time has left him so as to conceal this fact as much as possible,” continued the coverage. “Still, that shouldn’t be held against him.”",

    "content": "“The voice that spanned continents and oceans to win international acclaim is forever stilled,” announced a somber Pantagraph in October 1937. Was this the passing of a beloved opera diva or Irish balladeer? Well, not quite. Rather, the forever-stilled voice of international acclaim belonged to Mikey, Bloomington’s famous singing mouse. The Great Depression was a golden era for odd amusements, what with so many Americans eager for distractions from the hard times. During the spring of 1937, singing mice were the latest newsworthy diversion. Minnie, a mouse from Woodstock, Ill., made a national stir by performing live on the radio, gaining a local and national following along the way. Soon, stories of singing mice began popping up across the country. The saga of Mikey, Bloomington’s very own champion soloist, began during the winter of 1936. That’s when employees for the Vose Cooler Mfg. Co. on the city’s west side began hearing a bird-like trilling in the factory’s nooks and crannies and behind its walls. Mice “songs” such as those heard 80 years ago at the Vose manufacturing plant are said to be reminiscent of the “twittering, chirping, whistling or warbling of small birds.” The mysterious, melodious west side mouse was finally captured on New Year’s Day 1937 by business partners W.F. Vose and Jack Karstens. One of the tinners at the plant then constructed a cozy vaulted cage of wire mesh and tin, with a strand of solder running the length of the cage for play and exercise. Knowing of the recent fame accorded Minnie of Woodstock, Vose and Karstens decided to follow suit with Mickey (as Mikey was first called). The partners, though, didn’t know a thing about show business, so they turned to Gilbert C. Brown, manager of the Irvin Theater in downtown Bloomington. Soon thereafter Vose and Karstens sold their interest in Mickey to Brown, and the theater manager became the roundelaying rodent’s handler, stage manager, agent and publicist. By all appearances, Mickey was an ordinary gray mouse with a blotch of white on his belly. Today, we know that mice “sing,” though they do so at a frequency well beyond the range of the human ear. Males, for instance, employ intricate ultrasonic vocalizations not unlike birdsong to attract mates. And while it’s extremely rare, every so often there comes a mouse we humans can hear, though just why is not understood. One researcher involved in this fascinating field speculates that it might be some laryngeal imperfection that lowers the frequency of the vocalizations—low enough to be picked up by us. Back in 1937, Gilbert Brown saw to Mickey’s first radio broadcasts, as well as a $35-a-week gig in the lobby of a Peoria theater. Mickey also appeared at various events in the Twin Cities—from school activity nights to auto shows. “He sings—he croons—he’s got swing!” read one promotion. Mickey was kept at the Irvin Theater, which was located on the 200 block of East Jefferson Street (once the finest movie house in the Twin Cities, it was torn down in 1987). Fearing the talented entertainer might be the target of thieves, Mickey and his cage were secreted away to a closet under the theater’s semi-balcony. On Friday, Jan. 15, disaster struck when Mickey escaped captivity while Irvin Theater janitor Howard Brent cleaned his cage. The diminutive runaway found the theater’s hollow tile walls a perfect place to scurry away and hide. A day or so after the great escape he turned up in the organ pit near the movie screen, still on the lam. The search riveted the community’s attention. “There was no end of advice as to how to catch Mickey,” reported The Pantagraph. “Numerous theories as to the most succulent foods to be used as bait came in jumbled confusion through the telephone wires.” After two successive all-night vigils lying silently beside the organ pit, theater employee William Lyons’s patience paid off when he recaptured the furtive fugitive on Monday, Jan. 18, at 7:30 am. At some point Mickey became known as Mikey, the change likely prompted by the fact that the English champion carried the same commonplace name (common for mice, that is). In April 1937, the NBC radio network organized a national singing mice competition, with the winner to face several established international stars at a later date. The April 11 nationally broadcast contest was held in four cities—Chicago, Boston, Memphis and Seattle. A panel of experts listening in from New York rated the dozen or more contestants . Mickey performed in Chicago, from WCFL studios in the American Furniture Mart building on Lake Shore Drive. Thornton Burgess, a conservationist and children’s author, served as master of ceremonies. Mikey, in an Associated Press news account carried across the nation, “caroled steadily for an hour before the broadcast started, and continued throughout his allotted time on the air.” Other contestants had their troubles. The Indianapolis entry, for instance, escaped in the studio, and by the time he was corralled he was said to be too nervous to perform. “Naturally he wouldn’t sing after being chased for 45 minutes,” grumbled his handler. Declared the winner, Mikey had three weeks to prepare for the May 2 world championship against formidable competition—Minnie, the songstress from Woodstock, Ill., and the English, Wales and Canadian champions. Much like the national competition, Mikey benefited from the disappointing performances (or mostly non-performances) of his competitors. Johnny, the “Toronto Tornado,” remained silent his entire allotted airtime, “and even his trainer’s exhortation to ‘realize it’s for the glory of Canada’ failed to elicit a chirp.” The legendary Minnie was likewise mute before the mike. Mickey and Prissie, the English and Welsh champs respectively, were “in excellent voice and singing hard,” observed one English commentator. “I thought they’d win.” Yet Bloomington’s favorite son carried the day by a whisker’s length or more. “Mikey of Bloomington—terrific. A rich, fruity contralto—loud enough for the back rows of the gallery,” noted the commentator, who, in a pique of English stuffiness, added that the “Bloomington boy won, I’m afraid, on volume.” From Central Illinois factory mouse to international champion in four months! Alas, fame can’t forestall the inevitable, and the inevitable comes much sooner for mice than it does for men. For Mikey it came on Oct. 8, 1937. Since June of that year, the furry soloist had been a guest at the rural Plano, Ill. home of Jules J. Rubens, vice president of Publix-Great State Theatres, the chain that owned the Irvin. “There was no post mortem examination,” Gilbert Brown said, “but Mikey was placed in a little wooden box and buried with due obsequies. Some kind of a tombstone will be erected, I presume.”",

    "content": "“Cooks and counselors, painters and referees, they are also mom and pop to up to twenty children,” it was said of Louise and Napoleon Calimese not long before their retirement after nearly three full decades as caretakers of the Booker T. Washington Home on Bloomington’s far west side. Founded in 1918, the McLean County Home for Colored Children (as the Washington Home was first known) cared for children ages six to sixteen orphaned or from “broken and destitute” families. In its early years, the home was little more than a converted wood-frame, worse-for-wear residence on the 1200 block of West Moulton Street (since renamed MacArthur Avenue.) As the needs of the home grew, the grounds eventually encompassed an adjacent residence and several open lots, the latter used for gardening. The home for “colored” children was run by a board of fifteen philanthropic-minded women, all of whom were white. Raised in Normal, Napoleon Calimese first worked with his father Jerome and brother Burnice in the family’s barbershop on the 100 block of East Beaufort Street. At this time, it was common for African-American men to cut the hair of whites in communities such as Normal. With the U.S. entry into World War I, Napoleon served in an all-back infantry regiment, spending time in France. After the war, he married Louise Davis in Normal, and in 1927, the couple accepted an invitation to serve as the superintendent and matron of the McLean County Home for Colored Children. “The older girls with Mrs. Calimese do much of the sewing for themselves and others in the home,” noted a later report, “while the older boys with Mr. Calimese garden seven plots of ground which to provide produce for the table during the summer and their potato and root vegetable supply for winter.” The home’s children attended Bloomington Public Schools and local churches. Girls participated in 4-H, and field trips were taken to places such as Lincoln’s New Salem and Brookfield Zoo. Financial support came from donations raised by the board, as well as wider efforts, such as an annual fundraising drive known as Community Chest, a precursor of sorts to United Way of McLean County. In 1936, a two-story building replaced the increasingly ill-suited and cramped residences. The first floor of the new home included a dining room, kitchen, parlor and study; the second floor held two divided “dormitories”—boys on one side and girls on the other; while the basement included a game room. “In the home Mrs. Calimese is called upon to play many roles,” noted Pantagraph reporter Verla M. Crawford in a 1947 profile. “Besides seeing that the regular chores run smoothly, she often lends her shoulder for a little one’s tears. Again she gives motherly advice for character and personality development of the child. At other times she is busy planning parties for the group.” For newcomers to the home, adjusting to unfamiliar surroundings was often difficult. Louise Calimese said getting a child comfortable at the home required working “through your heart.” When children from the home faced racial prejudice from schoolmates, neighbors or others in the wider community, Louise Calimese strove to “instill in the child a desire and willingness to turn the other cheek and thus rise above the insult by sheet superiority in understanding and tolerance.” Such an approach, she believed, taught the child “to be big.” In 29 ½ years managing the home, the Calimeses rarely enjoyed leisure time together. “Although she works with her husband every day she says that they never get to go places together,” it was noted of Louise. “When one leaves the home, the other must stay, and if one takes a vacation, the other must wait to take his.” The Calimeses retired in the summer of 1957, moving back to Normal and living at a cozy house on the 1000 block of South University Street. Napoleon passed away in 1972 at the age of 82, and Louise followed in 1985. She was 90 years old. Upon Napoleon Calimese’s death, Blanche A. Walsh, a volunteer at the Booker T. Washington Home, penned a tribute to his life and career in The Pantagraph. “There will probably be no editorials nor encomium of Napoleon Calimese,” she wrote, “so I would like to give expression to the regard and respect to which this good man is entitled.” “At times, it was said that Mr. Calimese was a stern taskmaster,” continued Walsh, “but I know the welfare of the children was always his main objective. He was a just man and the children knew it. They knew he was always their champion when they tried to do right.” In the late 1960s, the Booker T. Washington Home merged with the Lucy Orme Morgan Home, a group home for white girls. Today, Children’s Home & Aid is the successor organization of these two local institutions. Under the watchful eyes of Louise and Napoleon, the west side home prepared countless at-risk youth for the rigors of adulthood. “Several have gone on to college and become teachers,” stated an overview of the home in 1950, “some [became] nurses, two are in the Air Force, one is studying radar in Mississippi, some have married and established their own homes.” The most famous “graduate” was Elizabeth Louise “Betty” Ebo, who lived there in the 1930s. Ebo converted to Catholicism, and after leaving Bloomington became a Franciscan Sisters of Mary nun, taking the name Sister Mary Antona Ebo. Long associated with the Archdiocese of St. Louis, Ebo was one of six nuns who became known as the “Sisters of Selma” when they stood front and center during a Civil Rights march onto the Edmund Pettus Bridge in 1965. She was asked why she came to Alabama to march with the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. “To bear witness,” she simply said. Sister Ebo was 93 years old when she passed away in Nov. 2017. The McLean County Museum of History holds in its archives the Booker T. Washington Home Collection. In addition to organizational papers, newspaper articles and promotional material, the collection includes a record book featuring a list of children admitted to the home from 1921 to 1950. This historically invaluable record book, for instance, tells us Betty Ebo came to the home on Dec. 8, 1930. Louise and Napoleon Calimese are featured in the 25th anniversary Evergreen Cemetery Walk, held the weekends of Oct. 5-6 and Oct. 12-13. The always popular event, sponsored by the county history museum and Illinois Voices Theatre-Echoes, showcases five other fascinating, real-life individuals, including Ebenezer Wright, an “Orphan Train” agent who lived in Normal. Tickets are available at the museum and cemetery. “I imagine in years hence when some interested person looks back to the history of the Booker T. Washington Home,” mused Pantagraph reporter Verla Crawford in 1947, “they will find it closely entwined with the personal story of Mr. and Mrs. Calimese.” Seventy-two years later, Louise and Napoleon Calimese, celebrated as they are in the Evergreen Cemetery Walk, proved that prediction true!",

    "content": "As a not-for-profit institution, the McLean County Museum of History depends on the generosity of the public to “grow” its object and archival collections. It is through donations of everything from early settler Isaac Jones’ homespun, hand-stitched denim suit, to Socorro Luna Alvarez’s Seventies-era Mexican bowls, that the museum is able to tell the stories of the past and preserve those yet told by generations to come. It’s a vitally important mission that the museum takes seriously. Somewhat counterintuitively, it is often seemingly mundane items that speak best to the richness of the past. Take, for instance, this Wolcott Co. invoice dated April 26, 1893. Donated to the museum in 2019 by Bloomington resident David M. Parker, it’s a bill to the estate of Dr. E.K. Crothers itemizing services rendered by the Wolcott undertaking establishment, located on the 200 block of South Main Street in Bloomington, and represented by E.N. Wolcott, manager and embalmer. The charges included $90 for a solid walnut casket; use of a horse-drawn hearse; chairs for the graveside service; and gloves, presumably for the pallbearers. Adjusting for inflation, the $130.25 bill would be the equivalent of something like $3,750 today. This document is fascinating in its own right, as it tells us something about the funeral business more than a century ago. Yet of even greater interest are the individuals mentioned therein. Edwin N. Wolcott was the son of John L. Wolcott, Bloomington’s very first undertaker. The senior Wolcott and his wife Caroline arrived in the city in 1843. Edwin was born the following year, and after serving in the 39th Illinois Infantry Regiment during the Civil War, he followed his father into the undertaking business. Dr. Eli Kirk (E.K.) Crothers—whose earthly remains resided in Wolcott’s casket— was an early Bloomington physician, In addition to his general medical practice, he operated a drug store and earned a reputation as one of the city’s more capable “occultists” (that is, eye doctor.) It was also Dr. Crothers who commissioned the erection of three adjoining commercial buildings at the corner of Center and Washington streets in downtown Bloomington. These 1855 buildings still stand, with current occupants including Scharnett Associates Architects and Scouts Downtown Cafe. Crothers’ wife, Marie Louise DePew Crothers, is generally believed to be Bloomington’s first female physician. “The Doctor Crothers” (as the husband and wife were sometimes called) featured E.K. specializing in “diseases of the eye and ear,” while Louise (she preferred her middle name) kept an office at the family home, treating women and children, and practicing obstetrics and gynecology. Their daughter Rachel eventually left Bloomington for the Great White Way to become one the leading American dramatists of the 1920s. Rachael Crothers enjoyed sustained success on the Broadway stage—writing and producing a series of sophisticated plays highlighting the patriarchal obstacles and double standards women faced in a rapidly modernizing nation. Scholars of Abraham Lincoln may care not a whit about Rachel Crothers or gender politics of the Jazz Age, but they surely know the name E.K. Crothers. And just why is that? Well, the good doctor was once Lincoln’s client in the medical malpractice suit, Fleming vs. Rogers & Crothers, better known by its informal name—the “Chicken Bone Case.” At issue was the claim by local carpenter Thomas P. Fleming that Crothers and Dr. Thomas P. Rogers improperly set his broken right leg, saddling him with a lifelong limp. Lincoln, in his spring 1857 summation to the McLean County Circuit Court jury, used two chicken-leg bones—one from an adult chicken and the other from a juvenile—to demonstrate the brittleness of the former vis-à-vis the latter. In so many words, Lincoln told the jury that given the severity of Fleming’s injuries and the fragility of his bones (he was, after all, a middle-aged man at the time), the plaintiff, rather than suing Rogers and Crothers, should be thankful to still have a right leg to complain about! After eighteen hours of deliberation, the jury failed to reach a decision. In the end, the case was settled out of court before the spring 1858 session. Who knew there was so much to learn from one old invoice!",

    "content": "The racial climate throughout the United States deteriorated steadily in the first quarter of the 20th century. During this period, Jim Crow practices—both written and unwritten—were adopted across the North in communities such as Bloomington-Normal. By the 1920s, African Americans were not welcome in most downtown Bloomington restaurants and hotels, and theaters had separate seating areas for blacks and whites. So in addition to longstanding discrimination in employment and housing, African Americans now faced the humiliations and degradations of separate and grossly unequal public facilities, such as the racially segregated beaches at Miller Park It was in the 1920s that the first spring dance for African-American students was held on the Illinois State Normal University (as ISU was known at the time) campus. From available evidence, it appears that starting around 1930, the “Negro spring prom” became an annual event, one which lasted through the mid-1940s and World War II. “This unfortunate campus activity,” recalled longtime (1927-1963) ISU sociology professor John A. Kinneman, “developed in the early thirties because some socially alert Negro students appeared at a dance sponsored by the sophomore class.” Herman H. Schroeder, acting ISNU president at the time (1930), “instructed the class officers to ask the Negro students to leave … The specious excuse was offered that the Negro students had not gone through the receiving line, and, therefore, were not eligible for admission.” “Apparently, they complied,” Kinneman said of the black students, “and, subsequently, asked for ‘equal time,’ in the form of a grant from the student activity fund. With this source of financial support, they conducted an annual dance for a goodly number of years.” This and other candid stories of ISNU come from Kinneman’s unpublished memoir, “It Occurs to Me: Incidents of Academic Experience,” held at the Dr. Jo Ann Rayfield Archives at Illinois State University. Black students at ISNU “are not permitted to attend the regular school functions of the school but are permitted to have a dance for all the Negro students each spring,” noted Edelbert G. Rodgers, in his 1932 essay, “The Social and Economic Progress of Negroes in Bloomington and Normal.” Rogers, who was African-American, attended Illinois Wesleyan University at the time. Despite the cloud of injustice hanging over the black prom, it was, by all accounts, a well-attended and delightful affair. The 1934 semi-formal dance, held May 19, featured Victor recording artist Eddie Johnson of St. Louis and his band (presumably the Cracker Jacks). Staged at McCormick Gymnasium on the ISNU campus, 175 couples danced nearly to the midnight hour. The university integrated in its early years, though the number of African-American students remained small until the postwar enrollment boom. As such, invitations were extended to local black high school students and residents, black alumni, and black students from others colleges and universities. And as was typical of these dances, African-American students were joined by some—but certainly not all—ISNU faculty members. Those attending the 1934 black prom 85 years ago included President Raymond W. Fairchild and his wife Nellie; Dean O. Lillian Barton; athletic coach and physical education instructor Joseph Cogdal and his wife Ann; John Kinneman and his spouse Marion; and others. The ISNU faculty was all-white until the 1960s, so the dance was, in its peculiar way, both segregated and integrated. “You probably want to ask the question, ‘What did you do for recreation?” remarked Edelbert Rodgers during an oral history given some 50 years after he attended IWU back in the 1930s. “Well, Illinois Normal did a little bit better. They had a spring dance ever year for the Colored. They talk about Lillian Barton—she was the Dean of Women. A very delightful lady, but they say that what she used to do when they [African-American female students] would bring their dates in there, she’d get right close to them to find out who had been drinking.” “Illinois Normal … was very fair towards its athletes. They had one man—I shall never forget—his name was Joe Cogdal,” added Rodgers in his oral history. “And Joe Cogdal was interested to see that his Colored boys had a decent place to stay when they went places. Joe Cogdal was the kind of guy that went to the spring dance. Brought his wife and danced.” Although Rodgers didn’t mention it, Joe and Ann Cogdal were said to be superb ballroom dancers! The black prom continued through World War II, with invitations going out to African-Americans servicemen stationed at nearby Chanute Field in Rantoul. Providing the music for the Apr. 28, 1945 dance was Howard “Toby” Davidson and his orchestra. Although bands at previous spring black proms were African-American, Davidson, a local saxophonist and bandleader, was white. “The theme of the dance is ‘heavenly paradise,’” noted The Pantagraph. “Dry ice smoke will add the finishing touch to a ‘heavenly’ atmosphere. A false ceiling will be made of blue and white streamers.” At the end of World War II, John Kinneman, the ISNU sociology professor, served as faculty sponsor for the racially mixed Inter-Cultural Club. Organized in 1945, members sought to promote diversity through education and equality through action. With regards to the latter, the club “attempted to secure equal services, especially in restaurants, for all students on the campus,” while also “developing a favorable climate for integrating housing facilities, both off and on campus.” Black veterans returning stateside in 1945-46 struggled to accept life as second second-class citizens after fighting overseas for the all-American, flag-waving principles of liberty and justice for all. “This was in the period immediately following the Second World War, after mature and thoughtful veterans had witnessed the behavior of Negroes under arms.” noted Kinneman in his memoir. It is at this time that the black prom was discontinued, as the very idea of a racially segregated dance became untenable to many students, faculty and area residents coming to recognize the enormous gulf between the nation’s cherished ideals and its real-world racism. In the fall of 1947, a group of black and white students began picketing the Pilgrim restaurant, which refused to serve black st udents (the building is still standing, occupied today by Alamo II.) Kinneman credited Raymond Fairchild, who served as ISNU president from 1933 to 1955, for helping to ensure that the Pilgrim integrated without further incident in December 1947. Kinneman, though, does fault Fairchild for not breaking the faculty color line, as the university president had the chance to hire an African-American ISNU graduate who went on to earn a PhD in elementary education from the University of Chicago. According to Kinneman, the university would’ve employed this eminently qualified individual had he come from a male-dominated academic field such as industrial arts. But the predominance of women as education majors and the idea of a black male professor were evidently too much to overcome. Regardless, it was a sorely missed opportunity for the university. Not until 1966—that’s 101 years after the end of the Civil War—did ISU hire its first tenure-track African-American faculty members.",

    "content": "The not-for-profit McLean County Museum of History recently celebrated a remarkable milestone: The posting of the 100,000th digitized Pantagraph negative on the Illinois Digital Archives website. Back in 2012, The Pantagraph donated to the museum an estimated 1 million photographic negatives. These negatives date from the early 1930s to December 2000, when this newspaper switched to digital photography. With the support of state and federal grants, the museum has seen to the archival digitization, cataloging, and preservation of Pantagraph negatives from the 1930s to 1951. Taken as a whole, these now-digitized negatives offer a stunning visual record of the Twin Cities and Central Illinois during the Great Depression, World War II and the early postwar baby boom. It’s great to have historically invaluable negatives preserved—both physically and digitally. Perhaps more exciting, though, is that the digitized photos created from scanning these negatives are then uploaded onto the Illinois Digital Archives ( www.idaillinois.org ) site, where the public can search, view and download them at no charge. Preserving pieces—or in this case, a big chunk!—of the local past is serious business, and it’s a mission the history museum takes seriously. Visitors to the Illinois Digital Archives website can search for Pantagraph photos by keyword or phrase—such as “African American” or “Miller Park.” The easiest way to access the digitized Pantagraph negatives is via the history museum’s website—www.mchistory.org. Simply go to the “Research” tab and click on “Resources.” Scroll down to “Pantagraph Negative Collection” and you’re on your way. There’s even a tutorial to help one navigate Illinois Digital Archives (IDA) databases. With Thanksgiving a few days away, it’s a good time to check the IDA site and see how many photos there are relating to the Corn Bowl. What’s that? You’ve never heard of the Corn Bowl? Well, as far as we’re concerned, Miami, Fla, can have its Orange Bowl, and Pasadena, Cal. can keep the “Granddaddy of Them All”—the Rose Bowl. In the spirit of hometown pride, we’re embracing the curious, doomed-to-failure Corn Bowl, a college football game held Thanksgiving Day in Bloomington for a half-dozen years beginning in 1947. And we’re in luck! A search of Pantagraph negatives on the IDA site turns up nearly 150 photos relating to the Corn Bowl. There are more to come, as history museum staff are working to bring additional months and years of photos online. As mentioned above, the Illinois Digital Archives holds Pantagraph photos through 1951. The 1952 photos will be uploaded in early 2022. Subsequent years will follow, though progress is dependent on financial support from friends and members of the museum, as well as success in securing additional grants. The first Corn Bowl, held on November 27, 1947, featured neither Ohio State nor Alabama, but rather Southern Illinois University and North Central College of Naperville. Co-sponsored by Bloomington’s American Legion Post 56 and the Hybrid Seed Corn Breeders of Illinois, the “bowl” game was played not in a bowl or stadium, but at Bloomington High School’s Fred Carlton Field (subsequent games were held at Illinois Wesleyan University.) “The Greatest Thanksgiving Event in the Mid-West,” was how Corn Bowl organizers with their corn-fed midwestern optimism billed the inaugural game—this despite the less-than-marquee matchup and venue! In its short history, the Corn Bowl was saddled with schools lacking both football tradition and fans—the 1951 game, for instance, pitted Lewis College of Romeoville, Ill. against William Jewell College of Liberty, Mo. Such lackluster matchups made it difficult to attract interest and excitement. The lousy, late-November weather of Central Illinois also helped keep fans away. The first and fourth games in the series were played in snow and ice; the third in a cold rain; and the fifth in snow and bitter cold. “The weatherman apparently has a curse on the Thanksgiving Day classic,” grumbled The Pantagraph after yet another miserable—meteorologically speaking—Corn Bowl. The 1950 Corn Bowl (pictured here) featured Missouri School of Mines (now Missouri University of Science and Technology), and Illinois State Normal University. By all accounts, it was a miserable affair for player and spectator alike, “A crowd that numbered nearly 2,500 at the start of the game dwindled to a few hundred before the final gun sounded,” noted Pantagraph sports reporter Ed Alsene. “The field was doubly treacherous, for underneath the hard-packed snow was a sheet of ice.” The visiting Miners netted all of 17 yards on the slick ground, while the Redbirds mustered a mere 7. The defensive standoff ended with the visitors from Rolla eking out a 7-6 victory. The cold was such that the Wilder Field scoreboard clock froze to a standstill in the first half. Happily, the Corn Bowl wasn’t the only small-time bowl game of the 1950-51 college pigskin season. Let’s not forget, then, the 1950 Burley Bowl (“burley” being a type of tobacco), held in Johnson City, Tenn., and the Refrigerator Bowl in Evansville, Ind., with Abilene Christian topping Gustavus Adolphus 14-7.",

    "content": "With no major navigable bodies of water, McLean County and much of east-central Illinois are landlocked. Yet that was decidedly not the case several million years ago when a great river—mightier than the mighty Mississippi even—ran through this part of the state. The ancient waterway, known as the Teays River, formed long before 2 million years ago. It drained the midsection of the eastern half of the U.S. before it was altered and then buried by a series of advancing and retreating continental ice sheets. Over many eons the Teays (pronounced “taze”) shaped and reshaped the landscape on a monumental scale and then disappeared long before human beings ever arrived in North America—so its deep, cool waters and wide valleys are known to us only through the geologic and hydrologic record. The river’s headwaters were in what’s now western North Carolina, near the village of Blowing Rock on the Blue Ridge Parkway. The Teays flowed north through Virginia and West Virginia, continuing into Ohio before taking a turn west through Indiana and Illinois. The river entered present-day Illinois near the Vermilion County community of Hoopeston. It headed east past what’s today Paxton in Ford County and then ran southwest through Champaign-Urbana, Mahomet and Monticello (see accompanying map). From there it tacked northwest to Clinton, its valley spanning some 15 miles at that point in its long journey. It then crossed the southwestern corner of McLean County and the Village of McLean before heading west to Delevan in Tazewell County, where it met the ancestral Mississippi River—which was then well east of its present-day course. The Mississippi was but a major tributary of the Teays, which then continued east and south until reaching the Mississippi Embayment, a finger of the Gulf of Mexico that once followed the current Mississippi River valley all of the way into Illinois. Subsequent glacial advances and meltwater during the ice ages of the Pleistocene Epoch marked the end of what was one of North America’s truly great waterways. The first of perhaps three glaciations, or glacial periods, blocked the Teays River and created Tight Lake, a massive body of water covering large sections of southern Ohio and parts of Kentucky and West Virginia. This long-gone “Great Lake” (about 70 percent the size of Lake Erie) was named for geologist William G. Tight, who in the early 20th century began piecing together the many clues left behind by the river. Tight, who taught at Denison University in Granville, OH, is also credited with naming the river, which comes from an unincorporated community in Putnam County, W. Va. This village sits in an unglaciated, now “riverless” valley that millions of years ago would’ve been the main channel of the Teays. As the massive Pleistocene ice sheets, measuring a mile-thick or more, scoured the Midwestern landscape, the mighty river’s valley and those of its tributaries were filled with ground-up rock, gravel, clay, sand, silt and sediment. Thus the bedrock valley of the Teays in much of the Midwest is still there, it’s just buried under several hundred feet of glacial “drift.” Today, the Teays is much more than a geological curiosity. The river’s buried bedrock valley is one of the largest and most important sources of ground water in the state of Illinois. The Mahomet Aquifer, as it’s known today, provides more than 200 million gallons of water every day to communities, industries, commercial enterprises and farmers across 15 counties in east-central Illinois. Aquifers, contrary to popular belief, are not true underground rivers or lakes. Rather, water in the Mahomet Aquifer resides between the granular deposits of sand and gravel and flows in a trickle, generally a few feet a day. Water pulled from this aquifer does not date to the Teays River, however. Rather, it started as rainfall or snowmelt that seeped through the ground until it collected in the ancient river bed. Nonetheless, the Mahomet Aquifer would not exist if not for the titanic geologic forces of rock, ice and water that gave birth to this colossal, now-buried river valley. Discovery of the Mahomet Aquifer helped geologists piece together the route of the Teays through Illinois. As early as the 1880s, a shaft sunk by a coal mine outfit in the Urbana area inadvertently hit the great aquifer—a discovery that led to the operators to “mine” not coal but water. Yet it wasn’t until later, in the mid-20th century, that scientists with the Illinois State Geological Survey and Illinois State Water Survey began examining in detail hundreds of well logs spanning the Illinois-Indiana state line westward to the Illinois River, enabling them to map the aquifer. Dr. Leland Horberg of the University of Illinois geology department discovered that wells above this area had to penetrate deeper than elsewhere to reach bedrock, and that the rock itself sloped downward to create a V-like shape, evidence of a buried riverbed millions of years old. Horberg named this formation the Mahomet Valley because it was near that Champaign County community that three wells reached one of the deepest points of the buried channel. It was only a matter of time before scientists concluded with certainty that the Mahomet Bedrock Valley (as it was formally known) was actually the lower section of the Teays River. “Although there is nothing in the present landscape to suggest the existence of a prehistoric and long-buried valley,” noted a newspaper account from 1952, “the river is gaining increasing notice from scientific prospectors engaged in a new gold rush—the search for precious water for the homes, the agriculture, and the industry of Central Illinois.” And indeed, that’s just what has happened in the ensuing decades. Today, the Mahomet Aquifer is the primary source of drinking water for some 120 municipalities and 750,000 people. Communities that rely on the aquifer range in size from the cities of Champaign and Urbana to the small village of McLean. Much of the water pumped out of the aquifer is used for industrial, commercial and agricultural purposes. The sweeping pivot irrigation systems one sees in Mason and Tazewell counties (and even in southwestern Mclean County) are dependent on the aquifer. In the coming years this aquifer will likely become more important as large communities currently relying on surface water reservoirs, including Bloomington, Danville, Decatur and Springfield, look to it as a means to improve water quality and meet increased demand. Today, the Mahomet Aquifer Advocacy Alliance, an informal association of local governments and interested parties, works to protect this invaluable natural resource through monitoring and research, legislative advocacy and public education.",

Unfortunately, the inferior quality of the monument’s marble and limestone was no match for the Midwestern climate, and the steady deterioration led to its razing a short 45 years later—in 1914. Back in 1866, one year after the end of the Civil War, McLean County voters gave the board of supervisors (the predecessor to the county board) authority to issue bonds for the construction of a soldiers’ monument. James S. Haldeman, a Bloomington dealer in marble, limestone and granite, received the contract to design and build the memorial. Its price tag was an astounding $15,000, the equivalent to a quarter million dollars today, adjusted for inflation. Haldeman’s design featured a lower base of Lemont limestone comprised of four octagonal columns. Upon these columns the names of the more than 700 war dead were inscribed, listed by unit and company. Above the columns were martial figures representing the infantry, cavalry, navy and a Zouave soldier (the latter a nod to regiments that adopted North African–inspired uniforms popular back then.) Above the marble figures were the words, “McLean County’s Honored Sons, Fallen but Not Forgotten.” Towering over that assemblage was an 18-foot-high tapered shaft, itself topped by a fifth figure, a colonel looking southward, his right hand holding field glasses and his left resting on the hilt of a sword. The monument reached 49 feet, from the ground “to the top of the colonel’s head.” Dedication ceremonies were held June 17, 1869, and began with a procession from downtown Bloomington to Franklin Park. “The Temple of Honor, the Odd Fellows, the German Benevolent Society, the Hibernian Society, the Turners, the fire [department] companies, all in their respective regalia and emblems, made a splendid display,” noted The Pantagraph. Once at Franklin Park, John L. Routt, the McLean County treasurer, called the “immense gathering” to order (in seven years time, Routt would become the first governor of the newly established state of Colorado.) Kadel’s Cornet Band provided the music, and Dr. A.E. Stewart, surgeon in the 94th Regiment Illinois Volunteer Infantry during the war, recited an appropriately patriotic and maudlin poem written for the occasion. Bloomington attorney Lawrence Weldon, who traveled the Eighth Judicial Circuit with Abraham Lincoln, delivered the dedicatory address. Yet the poor quality of the marble meant the monument’s carved figures, exposed as they were to Central Illinois weather, never had a fighting chance. In the spring of 1898, the artillery figure on the monument’s north side “fell to the ground with a frightful crash and was ‘shivered’ into small pieces.” A crowd soon gathered at the scene, with more than a few gawkers noting that the broken-up figure lay directly under word “Fallen” in the main inscription. “The marble,” observed The Pantagraph, “crumbled in the hand like sugar.” In March 1910, a second figure, this one of the south side, came crashing down. “The marble from which the figure was hewn, though originally hard and flinty, has disintegrated under the influence of the weather until it crumbles in the hand like salt, and as easily,” noted The Daily Bulletin, another Bloomington newspaper of the day. “At present it is a menace to passerby,” The Pantagraph said one month later of the monument, “and it is rapidly going to destruction.” The limestone facing was also failing, for by this time most of the names inscribed on the columns were weathered to the point of illegibility. The monument’s sad condition spurred elected officials, area veterans and community leaders to commit to the erection of a new one at Miller Park on Bloomington’s west side. Dedicated Memorial Day, May 30, 1913, the 78-foot tall McLean County Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Monument features eight bronze tablets with the names of more than 6,000 individuals who fought in wars spanning the American Revolution to the Spanish-American War. In late Oct. 1914, county and city officials jointly agreed to raze the Franklin Park monument. It came down two months later, a few days before Christmas Day 1914, with a heavy snowfall necessitating the pieces be carted off on sleds. The razed monument—“or any part thereof”—was then put up for public sale. “As much of the stone as possible is being sold to local people, who desire it in ornamenting door yards,” announced The Pantagraph. One wonders, then, how many of these relics can still be found resting on local lawns! At an undetermined time, the intact lower base, with its four worn-and-weathered limestone columns, was moved to an area northeast of the corner of Linden and Emerson streets, in what’s now the Briarwood neighborhood straddling Bloomington and Normal. Today, parts or all of several dozen names inscribed on this imposing, picturesque remnant are still legible. Those names include Pvt. Joseph Means, a farmer from Cheney’s Grove in eastern McLean County, who died June 29, 1863 at a camp hospital at Young’s Point, La. Means was a private in Co. F of the 116th Illinois Infantry Regiment, which included more than 80 McLean County men, all but a few of them from Cheney’s Grove. Organized in Decatur in the fall of 1862, the 116th participated in some of the bloodiest battles and campaigns of the war, including Vicksburg, Chattanooga and Missionary Ridge, Atlanta, and Sherman’s March to the Sea. Of the company’s 83 members, 26 were killed or died in the war, a fatality rate of 31 percent. Means, who was two weeks shy of his 33rd birthday when he enlisted, was married to Matilda Rankin. The couple had at least five children when Joseph marched off to war. The youngest, Marcus, was one-and-a-half years old at the time of his father’s death. Pvt. Means’ earthly remains were returned to McLean County, and he was laid to rest at Cheney’s Grove Township Cemetery. “May the sword be beaten into a plowshare and the spear into a pruning hook,” Lawrence Weldon said at the dedication of the Franklin Park soldiers’ monument 150 years ago this week, “and may our children dedicate monuments to the victories of peace, rather than the triumphs of war.”",

    "content": "The 1915 silent film “The Birth of a Nation” is acclaimed today as one of the greatest achievements in motion picture history. At the same time, and by many of the same critics and film historians, it’s also reviled for its sickening racism. A paean to the Ku Klux Klan and an unrepentant South after the Civil War, filmmaker D.W. Griffith’s 133-minute epic offered spectacle on a scale never before seen on the silver screen. He employed a cast of thousands for sweeping battlefield set pieces that remain a technical and artistic marvel today. He also pioneered many camera techniques, including the panning shot, close-up and panoramic long take. Then again, this technical artistry served a profoundly racist interpretation of the era after the Civil War known as Reconstruction. In this retelling, the Ku Klux Klan was not a terrorist organization murdering and maiming thousands of African Americans guilty of nothing more than seeking their constitutionally guaranteed rights and a measure of human dignity. Instead, the hooded Klansmen were depicted as heroes who restored white rule, putting an end to a brief period when African Americans were able to vote and hold elected office in the Deep South. African Americans or white actors in blackface were portrayed in grotesque fashion involving all the ugliest racist tropes, especially black males as sexual predators. Released in early 1915, “The Birth of a Nation” arrived in Bloomington on Thursday, Jan. 27, 1916, for a three-night run. It played at the Chatterton Opera House, a theater originally built in 1910 for live entertainment. The old building still stands today on East Market Street immediately west of Lucca Grill. “Nothing like it since the dawn of civilization,” screamed an advertisement for “The Birth of a Nation” in The Pantagraph. “Most stupendous, most realistic, most convincing, most exciting, most absorbing, most dramatic narrative ever created for the edification of the American people.” “Edification” of the wrong kind is what worried African-American leaders and those interested in racial equality. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), for instance, organized protests in New York and elsewhere. Despite its unabashed racism (or perhaps because of it) the film triumphed at the box office. There was even a screening for President Woodrow Wilson at the White House. In certain instances, the depiction of black depravity whipped thuggish whites into a fervor who would then seek out unsuspecting blacks for harassment or beatings. There were also riots in Boston and Philadelphia, among other cities. On the eve of the Jan. 21 Bloomington City Council meeting, The Pantagraph reported that the local African-American community planned to voice its opposition to the film with a petition. “It is claimed by the circulators of the petition,” noted this newspaper, “that the film has caused race prejudice and hatred in many places, and created prejudices against the Negroes wherever shown, and on this account they want it prohibited here.” There was even talk of council members traveling to a nearby city where the film was already playing so they could better judge its alleged inflammatory content. Yet there would be no mention of the petition in news coverage or published council proceedings, not for the Jan. 21 meeting or any of those following. Why the petition was apparently never presented is not known. Perhaps pressure was placed on African-American leaders to withdraw the protest, or perhaps they decided that such a protest was little more than tilting at windmills. Locally, African-Americans weren’t the only ones to protest “The Birth of a Nation.” On Jan. 24, the William T. Sherman post of the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), a national organization of Union Army veterans, adopted resolutions calling for the city to prohibit its showing. At issue for the Bloomington GAR post was not the portrayal of African Americans, but rather its portrayal of Union Army enlisted men and officers. At a time when local movie prices typically ranged from 5 to 25 cents, tickets for “The Birth of a Nation” at the Chatterton ran as high as $2 (or the equivalent of $43.50 today, adjusted for inflation). Even so, most of the Bloomington shows were sold out well in advance. “The box office at the Chatterton opened yesterday morning on what is, in all probability, the most remarkable seat sale in the history of local theatricals,” remarked the Jan. 25 Pantagraph. Rural and small town residents were also swept up in all the excitement. “LeRoy was deserted all day Saturday [Jan. 29] on account of the citizens all going to Bloomington to attend ‘The Birth of a Nation,’” read a typical dispatch. In response to the disheartening popularity of “The Birth of a Nation,” national African-American leaders talked of supporting a similar big-budget epic. Promoters envisioned “The Birth of a Race,” as the planned film was to be called, as a celebration of the vibrancy and resiliency of the black “race.” Birth of a Race Photoplay Corp. issued stock to finance the film, with liberal-minded folk, white and black alike, buying shares less as an investment and more as a statement against racial prejudice. One such individual was Bloomington dentist John A. Moore, who purchased 10 shares at $10 each in December 1917 (The collections of the McLean County Museum of History include Moore’s stock certificate.) “The Birth of a Race” had a troubled production history and by its late 1918 release the message of racial uplift had been discarded for the more traditional, less-threatening story of the American victory over Germany in World War I. All the same, the film was evidence that many Americans did not embrace Griffith’s delusional and dangerous misinterpretation of American history, either as fact or entertainment. In May 1919, “The Birth of a Race” had a six-day run in Bloomington, though it proved a far weaker box office draw than “The Birth of a Nation.” Griffith’s 1915 spectacle remains a landmark work in motion picture history. Contemplating its social, political and moral complexities, the late Chicago film critic Roger Ebert said “The Birth of a Nation,” was not a bad film in defense of evil, but rather a great film in defense of evil. “To understand how it does so,” he added, “is to learn a great deal about film, and even something about evil.”",

    "content": "Faced with the enormity of the Second World War, it’s often difficult to put a human face on the horror. “One death is a tragedy, a million deaths a statistic,” is a chilling observation attributed to Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. More than 330 McLean County residents lost their lives in the global struggle between the Allied and Axis powers. You can see their names on the McLean County World War II “Four Freedoms” Memorial on the east side of the McLean County Museum of History square. One name you’ll find is David F. McCorkle, an 18-year-old U.S. Army private killed in the Philippines on March 13, 1945. Now, thanks to a recently donated letter to the history museum, we have a story far richer than one simply fathomed from a name etched onto granite. The letter in question was written by Julia Scott Vrooman of Bloomington to Frank and Nelle McCorkle, the grieving parents of the fallen serviceman. The McCorkles farmed 160 acres for the Vroomans in the southeast corner of Bellflower Township, where McLean County meets Piatt and Champaign counties. The farm was located south of unincorporated Osman, a grain elevator station on the Wabash Railroad. “We had not heard, until Saturday the sad news of the loss of that splendid young son of yours,” Vrooman begins her Monday, May 21, 1945, letter, “and I am writing now to send you both our heartfelt sympathy in this great sorrow that has come to you.” Julia Vrooman was daughter of Matthew T. Scott, a wealthy McLean County landowner who first settled in Chenoa, turning thousands of acres of open prairie into tenant farms. Julia lived a privileged life of the Corn Belt aristocracy. She met her husband Carl Vrooman of Kansas on a “Grand Tour” of Europe—with the marriage proposal said to have come during a moonlight excursion on a Venice gondola. In 1900, Julia and Carl Vrooman settled at 701 E. Taylor St. in Bloomington (now the Vrooman Mansion bed and breakfast), where Julia’s parents had lived since 1872. Carl managed the family’s tenant farms, and his interest in progressive agriculture and Democratic Party politics led to an exciting few years in the U.S. Department of Agriculture during the First World War. It was at the end of that war that Julia Vrooman found herself touring U.S. Army camps in defeated Germany, boosting the morale of weary doughboys with her ragtag, ragtime jazz band. Two and a half decades later and another world war, one finds the Vroomans converting the third floor of their East Taylor Street home into apartments for soldiers stationed and training in Bloomington-Normal. When Julia Vrooman learned of David McCorkle’s death, she reached out to David’s sister Alice, who was attending Illinois State Normal University. “Perhaps Alice has told you of what a nice afternoon we had together,” related Vrooman in her letter to Alice’s parents. “I kept telephoning to her landlady Saturday, hoping Alice would be back in time to go to Chenoa with us. And sure enough Alice did get back and called me up. So she and her friend and another friend of mine went with us and we had a lovely ride and our first sunny afternoon in weeks.” The letter embodies Vrooman’s generous and high-spirited nature. “It was so nice getting acquainted with Alice,” she added. “I would know she was her mother’s daughter, if I met her in Europe! As she looks so much like Mrs. McCorkle. She is a fine girl and is making a fine record at school.” Indeed, Alice McCorkle graduated from ISNU and went on to a teaching career, putting in 4 years at Saybook, and another 20 years at DeLand-Weldon. She married farmer Robert Floyd in 1950, and it was one of their daughters, area resident Leta Buhrmann, who donated Julia Vrooman’s letter to the McLean County Museum of History. The McCorkle family has long cherished the letter, but Leta thought it time to find a safe and permanent home for it. The letter will be cataloged and housed in the museum’s climate-controlled archives, where it will be made available to family members, genealogists, students, researchers, community residents, and others for years to come. Julia Vrooman’s letter also gives us the opportunity to reflect on the life of 18-year-old Pvt. David McCorkle. He attended grade school in Osman and then high school in Bellflower, where he graduated in 1944. He joined the U.S. Army shortly after graduation, receiving his basic training at Camp Croft in South Carolina. He was overseas by December—if not earlier—and dead three months later. A week or so after Vrooman wrote her letter, the McCorkles received their son’s posthumously awarded Purple Heart. Nelle McCorkle also accepted a letter from her son’s company commander detailing David’s death. “He was killed by an enemy 91 mm mortar shell while on a reconnaissance patrol with his squad,” it read in part. “Death was instant.” McCorkle was interred at the U.S. Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE) Cemetery No. 1 in Zamboanga City, Philippines. In the years following World War II, the remains of tens of thousands of American war dead returned stateside for reburial in hometown cemeteries. Pvt. McCorkle’s earthly remains arrived at Stensels Funeral Home in Bellflower on Sept. 1, 1948. Two days later, funeral services were held at the Osman Methodist Church, with the Rev. S.N. Madden officiating. David McCorkle was laid to rest one last time at Blue Ridge Cemetery, not far from Osman. Julie Vrooman’s condolence letter is also a testament to the power of one’s faith. In it, she assures Frank and Nelle McCorkle that the Kingdom of Heaven is a place “where God’s will of joy can never be turned into grief, and peace can never be turned into terror, and life can never be turned into death.”",

    "content": "At the end of World War I, Bloomington citizens were given the honor of having a freighter named for their fair city. The trouble was that the obvious choice, “Bloomington,” was already taken. That’s why, in the end, the ship was christened “Evergreen City,” as that was the community’s longtime popular nickname (though now seldom used). The right to name a ship came about from Bloomington’s generous participation in the Liberty Loan program, an effort involving everyday citizens purchasing government war bonds to be paid back in several years time with interest. There were five loan campaigns spaced about six months apart, and although loan totals—at least those on the national level—fell short of expectations, billions of dollars were raised to help wage and win the “War to End All Wars.” “Evergreen City” was a direct reward for Bloomington’s success in the final—or “Victory”—Liberty Loan campaign, which got underway after the armistice and war’s end. Funds for this drive were used primarily for the demobilization of U.S. forces. The pride and joy of Bloomington was built at the shipyards in Bristol, Penn., located about 20 miles northeast of Philadelphia. “Evergreen City” was the 27th of 40 freighters of this type built at the Delaware River shipyard. Beginning in June 1919, The Pantagraph staged a popularity contest to pick a “young woman” to serve as Bloomington’s official representative in Bristol and smash upon the ship’s bow the obligatory bottle of bubbly. Blank ballots were printed in the newspaper, and readers were asked to vote for any female resident of Bloomington. Voters could submit multiple ballots, though each one cost ten cents (or the equivalent of about $1.40 today, adjusted for inflation). All the money raised went to Victory Hall, a planned home in Normal for disadvantaged boys (Victory Hall, at the corner of Hovey Ave. and Kingsley St., now serves as the Illinois State University Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity house). As one would imagine, those receiving votes were mostly young women in their late teens and early twenties from upper-middle class families whose names back then often appeared in The Pantagraph’s society pages. The top vote getter, though, had a much different story. Balloting closed Dec. 1, 1919, and the following day The Pantagraph declared Margaret Fenton the winner. Fenton, whose age was unknown but was at least in her early forties, was the beloved west side librarian to railroad workers and their families. Of the nearly 3,000 votes cast, Fenton received 1,198, 140 more than runner-up Gertrude Bohrer, granddaughter of Gov. Joseph “Private Joe” Fifer, and daughter to Florence Fifer Bohrer, who in 1925 became the first woman to take a seat in the Illinois Senate. “Miss Fenton is one of the best known women on the west side,” remarked The Pantagraph, “and railroad men were her chief supporters, although she received many votes from the others.” For 25 or more years, Fenton had worked at the Chicago & Alton Library. Located on Catherine Street, the busy reading center, which was little more than a cozy wood-frame cottage, served the employees of the sprawling C&A Railroad Shops. As Bloomington’s largest employer at the time, this was a city unto itself where upwards of 1,800 or more skilled and semi-skilled workers refurbished and rebuilt steam locomotives, and maintained, repaired and repurposed rolling stock. The little library, a stone’s throw away from the sprawling shops, offered boilermakers, steamfitters, sheet metal workers, locomotive engineers, brakemen, switchmen, clerks and many others of the C&A access to some 20 daily newspapers, 300 weekly or monthly magazines and all sorts of railway publications. The library, which was not company owned but rather funded by an independent employees’ association, also circulated about 5,000 books, a collection said to be heavy on fiction. Fenton, though kindly and helpful, had a quiet toughness that likely appealed to her many work-hardened library patrons, with their lined, grease-grimed faces and clothes dusted with coal ash. Thirty-four years before winning the “Evergreen City” christening contest, a young Fenton worked as a house girl for Bloomington bookbinder Amos Kemp and family (no relation to the author). That winter, January 1885, the Kemp’s cook stove exploded, grievously mangling one of Fenton’s legs, which was then amputated four inches above the knee. “She is of course crippled for life, but otherwise has entirely recovered,” The Pantagraph noted several months later. “Her affliction is a great one, but she has accepted it with remarkable fortitude and patience.” By the mid-1890s, if not earlier, Fenton settled into her job of a lifetime—that of Bloomington’s west side railroad librarian. Pantagraph coverage of the March 20, 1920 christening of the “Evergreen City” came courtesy of Harriet Hayden Finck, a former Bloomington resident who was president of the Pennsylvania Women’s Press Association. “At 2:50 on Saturday afternoon,” she reported, “with sun shining, the wind and tide just right, with whistles blowing and the party cheering, the big steel freight ship, ‘Evergreen City,’ was successfully launched from the Bristol shipyards.” Fenton, wearing a smart-looking gabardine suit of dark blue with lynx furs, performed her role without a mishap. As U.S. doughboys continued to return stateside and relief supplies were sent to war-ravaged Europe, the “Evergreen City” was put into service, making “many trips to European and Black Sea ports.” In 1934, after having been mothballed for several years, the old freighter was sold to a Texas firm. Four years after that sale, the ship was believed to be serving as a stationary oil platform in Terrebonne Bay on the southern coast of Louisiana. One supposes it was eventually sent to the bottom of the bay or sold for scrap. But what of Margaret Fenton, who, truth be told, has become the more interesting of the intertwined stories? She continued to work at the library until the summer of 1926 when the wood-frame building was moved and repurposed during an expansion of the railroad shops. “The Chicago & Alton Library was for a half-century one of the best known institutions of the west side,” observed The Pantagraph around the time of its closing. Fenton then succumbed to cancer in early 1927, passing away at the Aurora, Ill., home of her brother John. A member of Holy Trinity Catholic Church, she was laid to rest on Jan. 10 at St. Mary’s Cemetery on Bloomington’s west side. “The funeral was well attended,” reported The Pantagraph, “especially by Chicago & Alton employees.”",

    "content": "Bloomington’s streets were eerily quiet for several weeks in late November and early December 1872. Missing from the normally bustling downtown and surrounding neighborhoods were horses, and in the age before the internal combustion engine and the automobile, it was difficult to get from here to there without flesh-and-blood horsepower. The Great Epizootic, which had already ravaged the East Coast and major inland cities such as Chicago, had reached Bloomington. Nearly every horse, mule or donkey for miles around was sick or dying, relegated to barn or stable until the highly communicable strain of equine influenza burned through the area. Until it was over, it was difficult to shuttle passengers and goods from railroad depot to factory, store or home, since omnibus and dray lines (respectively, taxis and delivery trucks of the day) had no healthy animals. Public transportation also came to a halt, given that horses in Bloomington-Normal and hundreds of other communities were needed to pull street railway cars (this was before the electric era). The equine influenza was known as the horse flu or, more popularly, the horse epizootic (a word for a non-human epidemic). It is spread among horses, and exposure to manure and urine in tight quarters common in 19th century stables made for an ideal environment of widespread exposure. Symptoms included a fever, cough and heavy mucus discharge from the nose and mouth. For several days or more, infected horses would be listless, with heads cast down and little interest in either food or water, unable to pull or carry loads. The 1872 North America epizootic was the largest recorded outbreak of its kind in history. The first case appeared outside of Toronto, Canada in late September. By Oct. 10 it had crossed the international border and reached Detroit. The epizootic then swept through the U.S., eventually reaching Cuba, Mexico and even into Central America. It was still sweeping through Arizona Territory settlements as late as March 1873. The percentage of horses infected in the continental U.S. is placed anywhere from 80 percent to the high 90s. Mortality rates were highest in urban environments, reaching 10 percent in some cities, though more often than not the 1872 outbreak killed between 1 and 2 percent of the horse population in any given community. By Nov. 12, Bloomington’s anxious residents were all abuzz with talk of the looming epizootic then raging on the East Coast. “‘Has it come?’ ‘Have you got it?’ ‘How are your horses?’ These are the common salutations nowadays,” related The Pantagraph. The Daily Leader, a long-defunct Bloomington newspaper, advised area residents to brace for the worst and “lay in a good supply of fuel; and otherwise prepare to get along without the aid of horses.” The equine scourge reached Bloomington the third full week of November. The Leader reported on Nov. 22 that nearly all the horses in the downtown Ashley House stable had a “suspicious cough.” There were other ominous signs as well. “One of General [Asahel] Gridley’s horses is down, and is pronounced a clear case,” added the paper. “Dr. [Asa P.] Tenney, also, has a horse that is not expected to live.” The Pantagraph agreed with its competitor that the epizootic was here. “It is now estimated that about 200 horses have been attacked in this city within three days,” announced the paper’s Nov. 23 edition. Oxen, unaffected by the epizootic, were drafted into service. Accordingly, The Leader announced that “the gentle ox had made his appearance on our streets,” with a team of the burly beasts pulling a coal wagon. Once common during the early pioneer era, many of Bloomington’s younger residents marveled at the “singular sight … as though it was a team of elephants or camels.” Concluded The Leader: “Though not much for pretty, the ox is surefooted, and good for pull, and, above all, can bid deviance to the dreaded epizootic.” During these two long weeks human muscle also supplanted horsepower. “Many of the grocery merchants are delivering groceries with wheelbarrows and handcarts,” reported The Leader, adding that “in some instances wagons are hauled through the streets by men.” Marion Chuse, chief engineer of the Bloomington Fire Department, announced that horses of engine company No. 1 were out of commission, and in the event of a fire, he called for volunteers to “man the ropes.” By Nov. 26, the epizootic had spread to every corner of Bloomington, with The Pantagraph noting that “scarcely a horse in the city is free of it entirely.” The few horses still able to work were seen “blanketed and bandaged” on the city’s tranquil streets and alleyways. “Many ludicrous scenes occur during the day,” it was noted, “such as toting the mails to and from the depots by handcart.” The influenza was also called a horse “catarrh,” a term especially popular in the 19th century for inflammation of mucous membrane and congestion and soreness of the nose and throat. A panoply of dubious patent medicines and harsh treatments promised to cure equine influenza. Many so-called remedies, such as bloodletting, purging, drenching and blistering, did more harm than good. The Pantagraph, to its credit, ran an editorial urging “humane and common-sense” care centered on things like rest. Influenza’s grip on the local horse population began to loosen in early December. Street railway service was up and running by Dec. 7, and once again the horse enjoyed dominion over Bloomington’s thoroughfares. Thankfully, local fatalities were rare, probably numbering no more than a few dozen in the city. During the early days of the outbreak, the Leader commented on the prospect of life—if only for a week or two—without horses. “The people of this city,” the paper stated, “will have an opportunity to learn the real value of the noble horse, and how much we are all dependent upon ‘man’s best friend’ among the brute creation for comfort and convenience.” During the height of the local outbreak, The Pantagraph ran a humorously resigned poem about the epizootic titled “Hors De Combat” This poem, which appeared earlier in the Boston Commercial Bulletin, begins and ends with these stanzas: Upon my sole I’ve walked so much, Since horses have been hoarse, I feel like some pedestrian sport In training on the course. Then let us hope that horses may Be freed from all their woes, And running on their feet again, Instead of at the nose.",

    "content": "The Vietnam War, it’s been said, was fought on two fronts—in Southeast Asia and back home, especially on college campuses. On April 30, 1970, President Richard Nixon announced his decision to send U.S. troops into Cambodia to engage Vietcong elements that were active on both sides of the Cambodian-South Vietnamese border. For many, this represented a reckless escalation of an already unpopular war. Nixon’s decision was met with widespread unrest, culminating on May 4 when Ohio National Guardsmen killed four protesters at Kent State University. The following day, some 200 Illinois State University students occupied Hovey Hall, the school’s administration building. Eventually, about 75 students cornered President Samuel Braden in the office of the dean of students. Looking to defuse the situation, Braden agreed to demands that included lowering the ISU flag to half-mast for six days for Kent State, as well as for Mark Clark and Fred Hampton, Black Panther leaders killed the year before in Chicago. Furthermore, he also agreed to lower the flag on May 19 for the birthday of slain black leader Malcolm X. “The university deplores the incident at Kent State University,” Braden’s carefully worded statement read, “at which innocent students were killed, apparently in the course of expressing their legal and peaceful concern for new and unexamined developments in our foreign policy.” He also indicated that students were free, during the next week, to pursue “other forms of peaceful activity” in response to Kent State, even if that did not include attending classes. The same day students occupied Hovey Hall, May 5, a fight broke out near the flagpole on the ISU Quad between war protesters and a campus club composed of Vietnam veterans. Although Illinois State weathered its share of marches, rallies, and street scuffles, it was the only public university to remain open throughout the long, turbulent month of May 1970. The flagpole served as the focal point for a month of battles, both literal and figurative, between anti-war students and those who either supported Nixon’s decision or simply opposed student radicalism. President Braden was criticized for capitulating to student radicals, though to the consternation of pro-war (or anti anti-war) residents and students, he remained unapologetic. “You can say that the flag flies at half-staff over an open university here, while it flies over closed universities across the land,” he said. The May 6 Pantagraph featured two photographs of the American flag, one showing student protesters at the Massachusetts National Guard headquarters tearing it into strips to make arm bands, and the other showing U.S. airborne troops in Pleiku, South Vietnam, rallying around it before heading off to Cambodia. “Restraint is the misbegotten word of the decade,” The Pantagraph observed. “Those pledged to make war [on campus] must be deprived of a battlefield, expelled; but those who peacefully assemble must be protected. The sorting-out task is a sobering one.” On that same day, students marched to Normal’s Fairview Park to hold a memorial service for the Kent State four. That morning, someone or some group cut the flagpole ropes and hoisted a banner that read, “National Guard 4. Kent State 0.” Later in the day, a melee broke out after three protesters brought a Vietcong flag to the site. While vandalism plagued ISU the entire month, most of the incidents were relatively minor. University staff stayed in campus buildings overnight to prevent mischief, and members of the Academic Senate patrolled the Quad from midnight to 6 a.m. Illinois Wesleyan University, though, was not so lucky, as two fires set at Presser Hall caused more than $150,000 in damage. On Monday, May 11, Republican state senators called Braden to Springfield for a dressing down. At issue was why he buckled under the demands of student radicals. “I would not characterize it as being a friendly discussion,” Braden said after the closed-door Republican caucus. Alan Dixon, Democratic state senator from Belleville, was not as diplomatic, describing the meeting as “the grossest violation of academic freedom.” Two days later, Wednesday, May 13, students began vociferously protesting a curfew set by the Town of Normal. At 11 p.m., Braden spoke to about 3,000 students gathered on the Quad. “I’d rather that you would go home and go to bed, but I am going to be here all night and you can be, too, if you want to be,” he said. “If we can keep it on the campus, we can show what we have here at ISU—an open university.” Despite Braden’s plea, students and police clashed for several hours on School Street in front of Hovey Hall. Rocks were hurled at police, who responded with swinging nightsticks. Normal Mayor Charles L. Baugh finally agreed to lift the curfew at 4:15 a.m., a move that quieted the protesters. Fortunately, combatants on both sides sustained only minor injuries. Yet throughout the long month, a sense of normalcy prevailed on the Normal campus. Most of the school’s 14,000 students continued to attend classes, for example, even though they were given the choice to skip them for a week. On May 15, more than 4,000 folks crowded into McCormick Hall’s gymnasium for a patriotic rally organized by a group of students referring to themselves as the “no longer silent majority.” Speakers included Mayor Baugh and Gen. Richard T. Dunn, a Bloomington lawyer and Illinois National Guard commander. The group submitted a list of requests to Braden, which included the continued right of ISU police to carry firearms and the erection of an all-weather, properly lit flag which would fly 24 hours. Tensions increased again on Tuesday, May 19, when a group of construction workers raised the flag, which was supposed to be at half-staff for Malcolm X’s birthday. In response, ISU officials lowered the flag and ringed the flagpole with university vehicles. Braden, who stood inside with 44 ISU police officers and sheriff’s deputies, told the “hard hats” that anyone venturing inside the cordon would be arrested. Less than a week later, Braden backed a resolution calling for a national week of “mourning and unity” for servicemen killed in Vietnam. He balked, though, at calls to dismiss Carrol B. Cox of the English department. “If we dismissed every person whose out-of-class activity proved unpopular to the administration or community, we’d in effect be abdicating our role of a university in society,” he said. Although President Braden received a fair amount of scorn on both the right and left, he kept the campus open, calling that achievement “one of the proudest stories in the history of this institution.” For some critics, the end did not justify the means. Due in part to pressure from Springfield, Braden resigned as president just one month after the protests.",

    "content": "For a few years after the end of the Civil War, the Academy of Music was Bloomington’s most elegant concert and theater hall. And though destroyed by fire three-and-a-half years after its 1868 opening, the academy made a lasting impact on the city’s rich cultural history. Notwithstanding its name, the Academy of Music often played host to national theater companies, with stops lasting anywhere from the traditional “one night only” to upwards of two weeks. A traveling company’s repertoire might include Shakespeare tragedies, maudlin morality plays, sketch comedy, immigrant tales, minstrel reviews, historical pageants, picturesque travelogues and farces. Located near the southeast corner of Main and Market streets on the north end of downtown, Frederick Niergarth’s brick, four-story, dome-topped “amphitheater” had room for 1,500 paid theatergoers. Surrounding the “parquette” or main floor were two levels of seating (see accompanying image), with second level supported by 14-foot iron columns. Tickets for floor seats, known as the “dress circle,” were more expensive than those in the “family circle” above. Illuminating the whole affair were 150 gas fixtures with crystal glass globes and pendants. Under the parquette was a 45-foot diameter ring large enough to accommodate a traveling indoor circus or “menagerie” (animal show). For such events the floor was dismantled into sections and rolled (the undersides were equipped with rollers) beneath the 50-foot wide by 24-foot deep stage. It was 75 feet from the circus ring to the top of the dome, high enough for any type of 19th century daredevilry. Animals were ushered into the building through a large entryway off the rear alley, and then kept under the stage in a stable large enough to accommodate 50 head of horses. On April 8, 1868, the new performance hall held a grand opening with hundreds of local residents strolling through the building to the strains of Kadel’s Band. The evening served as a fundraiser for Niergarth, though just why is unknown, with tickets going for $3 per couple (the equivalent of more than $56 today, adjusted for inflation). “The beauty and fashion of the city were there,” noted The Pantagraph. There was still unfinished work, evident in the unpainted (or rather, un-bronzed) columns, though many of the touches, such as the hand-painted scenic drop depicting Italy’s Gulf of La Spezia, received admiring looks all evening. After some welcoming remarks, the crowd (“ladies and all”) then got to vote on a name for the new venue, with “Academy of Music” coming out tops. The evening ended with dancing into the midnight hour. “We think the Academy of Music may now be safely set down as the place that will draw the beauty, fashion and large crowds of this city,” surmised The Pantagraph. One public figure less than impressed with the new theater was Herman Schroeder, proprietor of an opera house on the east side of the courthouse square. He reminded Pantagraph readers that while the Academy of Music was now open … his opera house was decidedly not closed! Schroeder further noted the “repainting and retrofitting” underway at his place, and the fact (likely exaggerated) that its capacity was 300 to 400 more than any hall in Bloomington, including Niergarth’s. Edwin Forrest, considered by many the greatest actor of his generation, appeared at the Academy of Music over three successive nights in early April 1870, first in “Richelieu,” then “Jack Cade” and ending with “King Lear.” Tickets were $1 or 50 cents (25 cents extra for reserved seating), with a “full house, composed of the elite of Bloomington and Normal” for the first night’s performance. The 64-year-old Forrest still drew favorable notices. “Though advanced in years,” commented The Leader, a long-gone Bloomington daily, the famed thespian presented “the same calm majesty, the identical voice of thunder—in its low register, and the faultless clearness of enunciation, which render him peerless among actors of this or any country.” Katie Putnam and the Metropolitan Star Company held the Academy of Music stage for eleven straight days in September 1870, offering something new nearly every night and a few matinees in between. “Katie has lost none of her vivacity and sprightliness; she is as bewitching as ever,” observed The Leader. “It is impossible to describe her satisfactorily. There is a grace and finish in her acting … She is inimitable in her impersonations, and is by far the very best comedienne that ever visited Bloomington.” Metropolitan Star Company productions included an “opera comique” titled “The Daughter of the Regiment,” “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” “The Youth Who Never Saw a Women,” “Poor Pillicoddy,” “The Little Detective” and “Sketches in India.” On May 25-26, 1871, the academy welcomed the “famous young character comedian” Joseph K. Emmet in “Fritz, Our Cousin German.” As the absurdly named Fritz von Vonderblinkenstoffen, Emmet offered “charming characteristic mélange, songs, dances and instrumental solos.” And on May 27, the Philolethian Society staged the temperance melodrama “The Drunkard; or the Fallen Saved.” Beginning on August 29, Varney’s Comedy Company, with star attraction Annie “The Queen of Song and Dance” Ward in tow, appeared for four nights, with the shows including “Andy Blake; or the Irish Diamond.” The company also included two dozen dramatic and minstrel performers, as well as “Prof. Gilbert’s Juvenile Cornet Band.” Less than two weeks later, September 9, 1871, the Academy of Music was lost in a fire that claimed the entire downtown block bounded by Main, Market, East and Monroe streets, excepting a small blacksmith shop. Described as “one of the most destructive fires which ever visited Bloomington,” the intense heat was such that it buckled a nearby section of streetcar track along Main Street. “The high wind which prevailed rendered the scene magnificent,” reported The Pantagraph. “The flames leaped high in the air, twisting into spiral shapes as they were caught by the circling eddies of wind; then, shooting off to the west and south, they would dart towards other buildings, as if seeking new victims for their demonic rage.” Three days after the fire, The Pantagraph reported that Niergarth was “unable or indisposed to build at present,” as insurance covered only $12,000 of the concert and theater hall’s $30,000 loss. There would no rebuilding effort in the future as well. Niergarth, who was no stranger to money woes, almost certainly knew by then that the fire represented the Academy of Music’s final curtain call.",

    "content": "After World War II, Illinois State Normal University put out the welcome mat for returning soldiers and sailors looking to reintegrate into civilian life. By the fall of 1945, the war had come to a close with Victory over Japan (V-J) Day, September 2. Yet preparations for the return of veterans were well underway, as many from Europe and elsewhere were already discharged and either back home or in the process of returning stateside. As a result, during the 1945-1946 academic year, ISNU offered a new veterans’ student organization, a federally funded veterans’ counseling center, a faculty committee on veterans, and even a campus-based high school for veterans who, due to the war, were unable to finish their secondary education. At this time, ISNU was still a “normal” school, meaning the education of teachers was still its primary mission. It was thought that teaching was an ideal postwar profession for many veterans who, if nothing else, returned from war-torn Europe and the Pacific instilled with leadership skills, discipline, motivation and other personal and social proficiencies translatable—in theory at least—to the classroom. During the 1945-1946 school year, Walter V. Brown, state director of veterans’ education and rehabilitation, addressed the Golden Eagles, the newly established veterans’ student organization at ISNU. “You are preparing for a much-needed profession, and the Veterans’ Administration is pleased to have so many veterans enrolled at the oldest state teachers college in Illinois,” he told the group. Joe Cogdal, ISNU’s legendary basketball and track and field coach, served as the Golden Eagles’ faculty sponsor. Established in the spring of 1945, the Veterans’ Guidance and Counseling Center on the ISNU campus served the physical and emotional needs of able-bodied and disabled veterans. It was one of a several such centers in the state, all operating under the direction of the Edward Hines Jr. Veterans Administration Hospital outside of Chicago. The ISNU center covered a 15-county area, which reached as far north as Stark and Marshall counties, and as far south as Christian County. The Guidance and Counseling Center was first located on the second floor of Cook Hall, but was later moved to a recently vacated U.S. Navy infirmary on the 300 block of West Mulberry Street. The infirmary had been part of a campus-based naval training program. ISNU faculty from the special education and psychology departments helped staff the center. Disabled veterans were encouraged to seek vocational training, with radio, refrigeration, business administration and auto mechanics said to be the four most popular occupational tracks. Many of these veterans then had the option to continue their education at a college or university, a business or trade school, or through an apprenticeship in the trades. When it closed in the spring of 1947, the Guidance and Counseling Center had tested or counseled more than 800 veterans. The campus-based veterans’ school, which operated from September 1945 to June 1947, offered servicemen and women a chance to complete their high school education interrupted by wartime service. Dr. Victor M. Houston, principal of University High, acted as the new school’s administrative head. ISNU faculty members serving as tutors included Dr. Nell Waldron, professor of social science (see accompanying photograph), and C.L. Cross and Leon Smith, both professors of physical science. The school, it was said, offered veterans the “opportunity to complete high school work without actually reenrolling in high school.” Most of the instruction was one-on-one, on an “accelerated tutorial plan,” though students did meet in small groups as necessary. Under the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, commonly known as the GI Bill, veterans were only responsible for the cost of their books and room and board. Students at this veterans’ school worked at their own speed, and could choose one of two courses of study. Upon attaining “sufficient knowledge of the fundamentals of the field,” some students opted to take a subject-specific test to earn credit for that course, and after passing a predetermined number of courses they received their diploma. A more popular path to graduation involved General Educational Development (GED) tests, which came about during WW II for this specific purpose. In late 1942, the Armed Forces Institute called upon the American Council on Education to develop a series of examinations to measure academic aptitude at the high school level (in the subjects of reading, writing, social studies, science and mathematics), so returning soldiers and sailors whose education was cut short by the war could more quickly and easily earn a high school diploma. Today, GED can also stand for General Equivalency Development or General Equivalency Diploma. Graduates of the veterans’ school also had the choice to receive their diploma through University High or from their school back home. Not surprisingly, most out-of-towners stayed true to their roots and preferred the sheepskin coming from their hometown high school. And many of those who received high school diplomas through this veterans’ program continued their education. Fifteen of the 18 students who graduated in late January 1946, for instance, promptly enrolled at ISNU. Fifteen veterans, ranging in age from 20 to 45 years old, earned highs school diplomas in late May 1946. This graduating class included Amy Wiggers of Bloomington, the first woman to graduate. Wiggers participated in May 31 University High commencement ceremony at ISNU’s Capen Auditorium. Forty-five year old Donald G. Joda, on the other hand, received his diploma from Fairbury High School in Livingston County. Because veterans studied at their own pace, some proceeded cautiously, while others raced through the subject matter at breakneck speed. No one, though, likely beat Jay Dawson Carpenter’s record pace. “Completes 2 years of school in 2 days,” marveled The Pantagraph in early April 1946. Before the war, Carpenter completed two years at Empire Township High School in LeRoy. He then served six years in the U.S. Army, rising to the rank of captain as an intelligence officer with the 42nd Division in Europe. After his discharge on March 6, 1946, Carpenter returned to McLean County (his parents were now living in Normal), and enrolled in the veterans’ school. After two days of classes, he announced he was ready to take the GED tests and qualify for a high school diploma. And sure enough, he passed with relative ease. On April 6, one month after his discharge, Carpenter received a diploma from his old school, Empire Township High. In August 1946, 23 students received diplomas from the veterans’ school at ISNU. Graduates included Bette Cleinmark and Alvin Schad, both of Bloomington, and 22-year-old identical twins David and John Haenni of Staunton, Ill. There were also graduates from a scattering of Central Illinois communities, including Clinton, Minier, Minonk, Odell, Shirley, Streator and Washington. In its nearly two years of existence, 186 men and women enrolled in the veterans’ school, with more than 200 earning general equivalency diplomas.",

    "content": "One hundred years ago today, November 11, 1918, the guns in Europe fell silent after more than four years of unrelenting carnage. World War I claimed the lives of some 9 to 11 million soldiers and 8 million civilians. The armistice between Germany and the British, French and American Allies famously took effect on the “eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month” (though the Treaty of Versailles marking the war’s formal end wasn’t signed until 1919). In the aftermath of the “Great War’s” end, anguished communities across the United States counted up their dead and began making plans to memorialize those who made the ultimate sacrifice. McLean County was no exception. Locally, veterans, public officials and community leaders worked together to erect an 87 by 65 inch memorial tablet. The 1,000-pound, oversized bronze plaque features the names of 173 fathers and sons who lost their lives in a conflict cruelly known as the “War to End All Wars.” The tablet, titled “In Memory of the Soldiers and Sailors of McLean County Who Died in the World War,” also includes five bas-relief vignettes. One scene above the memorial’s three columns of names features an Allied convoy crossing the Atlantic Ocean, while the other depicts an aerial dogfight, with one biplane aflame and plunging to a fiery end. The three scenes at the bottom include one depicting naval deck guns engaging the enemy fleet, and two frontal assaults across the Western Front’s hellish landscape of trenches, palisades, wrecked equipment and exploding artillery shells. In the fall of 1920, the McLean County Board of Supervisors passed a resolution supporting the erection of a “splendid bronze tablet, a fitting memorial to the dead heroes from this county who sacrificed their lives in the late war.” The American Legion Louis E. Davis Post 56 of Bloomington and other organizations and individuals helped the county clerk compile a list of war dead. While that effort was underway, the Board of Supervisors brought in Bloomington architect Arthur F. Moratz to design the memorial. Born in Bloomington to German parents, Moratz studied architecture at the University of Illinois. Some of his better known buildings include Bloomington’s Holy Trinity Catholic Church (1932) and the Normal Theater (1937). In late 1920, the county, using Moratz’s drawings and specifications, solicited bids for the casting and fabrication of the tablet. In February 1921, the county rejected the only two bids it received (one from New York and the other New Jersey) as too pricey, so they started over. This delay proved fortuitous, because in the second round of bidding they happened upon the talented sculptor George H. Honig of Evansville, Ind. In April 1921, the county’s public buildings committee accepted Honig’s bid of $1,700 (or the equivalent of $23,500 in today’s dollars). A Rockport, Ind., native, Honig was an artist and sculptor who worked in a wide range of mediums, including oil, charcoal, watercolors, plaster, stone and metal. Some of Honig’s more notable works include two bronze groups at the entrance of Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Coliseum in Evansville, and six commemorative bas-relief tablets at the Henderson, Ky. courthouse depicting the state’s pioneer history. There are several dozen memorial tablets in Honig’s name, most found in southern Indiana, especially Evansville, as well as Henderson, Ky., situated across the Ohio River from Evansville. He’s also credited with several works in Illinois, including a memorial in Paris, Ill., listing veterans of the American Revolution buried in Edgar County. The McLean County World War I tablet arrived in Bloomington in early October 1921, with a visiting Honig superintending its installation in the county courthouse. Yet plans to build a veteran’s memorial building complicated matters, as some community leaders believed the new building would be a better fit for the Moratz-Honig artwork. And indeed, the bronze tablet was relocated to the three-story, Neoclassical-style McBarnes Memorial Building about the time it opened in the spring of 1923. Located on the 200 block of East Grove Street and designed by Arthur Moratz (yes, him again), the building originally housed the Illinois department of the American Legion offices, as well as club rooms and meeting space for local veteran organizations and posts. The tablet honors McLean County’s fallen—whether they lost their lives in training exercises, through camp-borne sickness, or on the battlefields of Europe. There’s a poignant story behind each of the tablet’s 173 names. Lee J. Roebuck, for instance, was the very first McLean County resident to die in the war, though he served under the Canadian flag. He first attempted to join U.S. Army as an aviator, but was rejected due to a heart defect. On Oct. 20, 1917, Roebuck’s Canadian-made trainer fell apart in midair during a training flight in Ontario. Dewey Burger, who grew up on a farm outside the Village of McLean, enlisted on the same day with three of his brothers. He was killed in action at Soissons, France, on Jul. 19, 1918, though the details of his death are few. Wounded on Sept. 30, 1918, by shrapnel or machine gun fire (accounts differ), Pvt. John M. Redd remained in a French hospital when his regiment, the famed “Black Devils,” returned stateside. Redd never recovered and died in France. The tablet, of course, offers an additional 170 similarly tragic stories. After the county sold the McBarnes Memorial Building in 2004, local officials decided it best to return the tablet to the old courthouse, which is now home to the not-for-profit McLean County Museum of History. Today, the memorial can be seen in the north corridor of the museum’s first floor, next to the “Farming in the Great Corn Belt” exhibit (ironically, this was about where it was originally located 83 years earlier). A rededication ceremony for the reinstalled tablet was held May 29, 2004. At one point during its many years in the McBarnes Building lobby, the tablet was painted gold, though the reason why such a garish finish was deemed necessary in the first place is unknown to this author. Happily, the county hired Randy Reid, a local sculptor and Illinois State University professor of art, to remove the gold paint and restore the tablet to its original bronze patina. The annual Veterans Day ceremony is scheduled today from 10 a.m. to noon on the east steps of the McLean County Museum of History. The centennial of the armistice is a most fitting and proper time to honor those who gave their lives in service to this nation. In October 1921, soon after the tablet was first installed in the courthouse, The Pantagraph paid its respects to those memorialized on its bronze: “Silence has fallen upon their lips, and stillness on their forms, but their names alone breathe eloquence born of the long struggle of the World War, the burden of which fell upon their shoulders, that will forever inspire the tears of grateful memory as generations come and go.”",

    "content": "Cousin Emmy, a pioneering female country music artist affectionately known as “the first hillbilly to own a Cadillac,” spent a decade or more in Bloomington just as her national career was taking full flight. It was here in Central Illinois where she honed her already formidable musical talents and began developing her own colorful stage persona. By the mid-1930s and the Great Depression, banjo pickin’, guitar strummin,’ fiddle playin’ singer-songwriter Cousin Emmy was known to radio listeners across much of the U.S. and Canada. Born in 1903 in south-central Kentucky, Cynthia May Carver came from a large sharecropping family, the second youngest of seven children. As with most “hillbilly” performers during the golden age of radio’s many barn dance program, Cousin Emmy played up her hardscrabble roots—both real and imagined. “I was raised in a log cabin with cracks so big you could throw a cat through it and never touch a hair!” she would say. “I started strippin’ ‘tobakker’ when I was eight, I reckon.” Her schooling, it was said, lasted but two weeks, and she learned to read by studying mail order catalogs. May’s (as Cynthia was known) family was intimately steeped in the vernacular musical styles of Appalachia and the wider region; her father Henry being a well-regarded fiddler and her mother Molly a banjo player. Sometime around 1917, Henry and Molly Carver divorced, with Molly taking daughters May and Pearl and her four sons to Bloomington. One older son, Hazie, remained in Kentucky only to flee the state after shooting a man. He was then killed in Iowa during a poker game. Pearl, the oldest child, came to McLean County already married, and she and her first husband Guy Houchens farmed for a time in Old Town Township east of Bloomington. She eventually remarried and died in the Twin Cities in 1982 at the age of 89. In Bloomington, Molly Carver kept food on the table by working as a housekeeper and whatnot, while the boys became farm laborers and construction workers. Moss Carver, the youngest child, ended up working in the local cement finishing and contracting business. He remained in Bloomington for the rest of his life, passing away in 1980. Meanwhile, by the mid-1920s, youngest daughter May and her brother Burton began performing around the Twin Cities and Central Illinois. Appearing as “Joy White,” her musical repertoire eventually included some fifteen or more instruments, including the banjo, guitar, fiddle, piano, accordion, saxophone, harmonica, ukulele, jaw-harp and musical saw. Country music as we know it today developed in the 1920s and 1930s through the then-novel and utterly transformative mass communication medium of radio. Accordingly, in 1927 or 1928, May and her brother Burton began appearing on WMBD AM 1470 in Peoria. Burton Carver, though, didn’t take to show business like his sister, and soon May was left to forge her own independent career. Sometime in the mid-1930s, May Carver assumed the stage name Cousin Emmy. At the time, she appeared regularly on WHAS in Louisville with Frankie More’s Log Cabin Boys. Two years later, May Carver began performing with her own band—Cousin Emmy and Her Kin Folks (later spelled “Kinfolks” as one word.) By 1943 she was headlining a daily (except Sundays) early morning program on 50,000-watt KMOX out of St. Louis. In early December of that year, Time magazine profiled the rising star in its radio column. “Cousin Emmy is a slightly faded blonde of about 30 with a voice like a locomotive whistle and a heart of gold,” read the profile. “She has a broad bony face, a wide mouth, lots of platinum-colored hair, immense enthusiasm, and masterly capacity for mugging.” She dressed the part too, wearing checked, gingham and plaid dresses, topped off with a big bow in her hair. Unlike many of her contemporary Appalachian balladeers who favored haunting melodies and tragic narratives, Cousin Emmy was best known for her “comedy rube act” and “brassy and even outrageous personality.” Her performances included stunts like pulling a harmonica out of her cleavage. “Aint’ no tellin’ what I’ll pull out next,” she would say. She also played musical numbers on a rubber glove fitted with a nozzle and a hole in the middle finger. That’s not to say she couldn’t rattle the church rafters with a poignant rendition of “Graveyard” or other more traditional songs rooted in Old Testament suffering and New Testament redemption. Time magazine described Cousin Emmy as a “teetotaling, nonsmoking, unprofane Baptist.” Well, we know from her later visits to Bloomington, she drank and smoked, though as to her profanity or lack thereof, we cannot say! Publicly, Cousin Emmy maintained that she was a committed single gal. “I ain’t got time to do no courtin,’” she would say. Yet we now know, thanks to recent research by Hunter Randolph, a student assistant with the University of North Carolina’s Southern Folklife Collection, that she was married at least twice, perhaps three times, with one divorce coming in 1949 to a St. Clair County (Ill.) farmer. During the folk revival of the 1960s, Cousin Emmy and many country music performers were rescued from relative obscurity by younger musicians and fans seeking the hipster holy grail of authenticity. She appeared on Pete Seeger’s “Rainbow Quest” folk music TV program, for example, and recorded an album with the New Lost City Ramblers. Cousin Emmy also played a tangential role in one of the seminal moments in rock and roll history. On July 25, 1965, at the Newport (R.I.) Folk Festival, Bob Dylan “went electric” for part of his set, eliciting boos from purists in the crowd. And who preceded Dylan on stage? Why, none other than Cousin Emmy! In February 1973, she performed at Illinois State University as part of the New Friends of Old Times Music series in what was likely her last public performance in the Twin Cities. Cynthia Mae Carver passed away on Apr. 11, 1980 at Sherman Oaks, Cal, at the age of 77. Tune in next Thursday, Mar. 14, to WESN 88.1 FM for a special “Downstate Sounds” program on Cousin Emmy. This writer will join program host Chris Young for an hour of music and talk celebrating the life and times of Cynthia Mae Carter. Young’s weekly radio show, devoted to the music of the Twin Cities and other downstate communities, airs on Illinois Wesleyan University’s student radio station. “Downstate Sounds” also streams live on wesn.org, and past shows, playlists and bonus material can all be found at downstatesounds.com. Although rooted in the rich musical traditions of the Bluegrass State, Cousin Emmy also claimed the Land of Lincoln as a place close to her heart. “The nicest people around, and I’ve been all over the world entertaining—well, I always did say Illinois was a fine state. The best in the union,” she said during a 1965 visit to Bloomington. “I lived here when I was younger, you know.”",

    "content": "On Jun. 23, 1916, the minor league Bloomington Bloomers hosted the major league Chicago White Sox in a mid-season exhibition game. Some 4,000 people crammed into Fans Field on Bloomington’s south end for the David and Goliath contest. It was said to be the largest crowd in local baseball history, at least up to that time. With future White Sox Hall of Famer Ed Walsh pitching the first six innings, the visitors escaped with a hard-fought 3-1 victory. At the time the White Sox were on the road and in midst of a five-game series against the St. Louis Browns, but having a day off they made the day trip to Bloomington. They traveled on the Chicago & Alton (C&A) Railroad, arriving in Bloomington at 1:30 p.m. and returning to St. Louis on a 1:00 a.m. train. In this era, some major league owners viewed off days during the 154-game season (the current 162-game schedule dates to 1961) as little more than lost revenue. As such, on days off they sometimes scheduled exhibition games with minor league clubs, splitting the gate receipts with their hosts. On Aug. 24, 1916, two months after holding their own against Chicago, the Bloomington Bloomers defeated the visiting Boston Braves 5-0 behind Charles “Rube” Schlansker’s nine shutout innings. There were 2,000 spectators in the stands, a good showing given most everyone in the Twin Cities and surrounding countryside had flocked to the massive farm tractor show on the city’s east side. In fact, many of the Boston players spent the morning before the game at the tractor show as well! With a tighter-than-expected schedule, local officials had to cancel a postgame reception for the Beantown visitors. With a series against the White Sox set to begin the following day, the Braves decided it best to dress at the ballpark before boarding a 5:30 p.m. northbound C&A to Chicago. From 1901 to 1939, the Bloomers played in the Illinois-Indiana-Iowa League. The “Three-I” was a well-regarded minor league that over the years had successful teams in small and medium-size cities, including Springfield and Peoria, Ill.; Evansville and Terre Haute, Ind.; and Cedar Rapids and Davenport, Iowa. Bloomington, situated as it is between St. Louis and Chicago on what was then the C&A mainline (tracks today owned by Union Pacific and used by Amtrak), was a convenient stopover for big league clubs looking to boost their bottom line. Not all exhibition games were held during the regular season. Others occurred in the spring as major league teams left their warm-weather training sites and made their way—exhibition game by exhibition game— to their home ballparks. Though Bloomington beat the Boston Braves in 1916, other exhibition games against major league competition ended far less favorably for the hometown heroes. Back in early April 1903, for instance, the Bloomers were crushed by the visiting Chicago White Sox 18-0. “It was useless from the first,” reported a disappointed Pantagraph. “There were some 400 fans out to see the alleged game, not because they expected the Bloomington team to win, but because they wanted to see how the White Sox play … But they were not entirely prepared to see them wipe up the earth with our home team and then throw the rag away.” On Apr. 12, 1910, the Chicago Cubs wrapped up their 1910 spring training schedule in cold, wet and windy Bloomington. With the south side park little more than a “vista of mud,” Chicago unceremoniously dispatched the Bloomers 14-4. The weather and field conditions left the visitors “disgusted with their experience,” noted The Pantagraph. During the 1917 season, though, the Bloomers managed to give the Cubs a run for their money. With the Jun. 25 game tied 2-2 after nine innings, Chicago ended the upset bid by rattling off 5 runs in the top of the tenth frame. “Nine beautiful innings. One nightmare,” lamented The Pantagraph. In 1919, the Bloomers played two N.L. teams in a one-week stretch. The Cubs, with two days off between a 3-0 victory in St. Louis and an upcoming home series against Brooklyn, stopped in Bloomington for a Jul. 29 game. The Bloomers were led by catcher Walter “Butch” Henline and infielder John Henry “Heinie” Sand. The two, who would go on to become teammates with the Philadelphia Phillies and enjoy solid major league careers, helped Bloomington beat the defending National League champions 3-0. Six days later, Sep. 4, the Cincinnati Reds topped the Bloomers 5-2 before some 2,500 “bugs” (an anachronistic term for fans) at Bloomington’s cozy ballpark. One month later Cincinnati defeated heavily favored Chicago in the infamous 1919 World Series tainted by the “Black Sox” match fixing scandal. On Aug. 16, 1921, the Washington Senators, en route to St. Louis for a two-game series against the Browns, were in Bloomington for an exhibition game. This contest was of special interest to many Twin City residents because Washington owner Clark Griffith grew up in Normal and began his professional baseball career in 1887 with the short-lived Bloomington Reds. The Bloomers bested Griffith’s Senators 6-1. Many of the highlights that day were supplied by Washington coach Nick Altrock, known as the “Clown Prince of Baseball.” The locals got a kick from Altrock’s “inimitable mimicry of umpire Matty Fitzpatrick,” among his other antics. “It is doubtful which the fans enjoyed the most,” surmised The Pantagraph, “the slaughter of the Senators or the stunts of Nick.” In 1935, Bloomington was an affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals and coached by the recently retired big league spitballer and future Hall of Famer Burleigh “Ol’ Stubblebeard” Grimes. On their way to Chicago, the big league Cardinals, having just taken both ends of a Memorial Day doubleheader against Cincinnati, stopped in Bloomington for a May 31, 1935 exhibition. With a key series against the first-place Cubs beginning the next day, Cards player-manager Frankie Frisch sent little used Nub Kleinke to the mound. In contrast, Bloomington relied on right-hander Bill Cox, a promising prospect from the Cardinals affiliate in Columbus, Ohio. Cox pitched 9 solid innings as Bloomington walloped St. Louis 11-1. To the disappointment of many, fan favorite Dizzy Dean did not pitch. Instead, he spent much of the time coaching from the sidelines, providing a humorous running commentary of the game that could be heard throughout the park. Dizzy and his brother Paul were notoriously uncooperative during the Cardinals many exhibitions. St. Louis owner Sam Breadon viewed such games as a welcomed revenue-generator during off days, while the Dean brothers would’ve simply preferred the day off.",

    "content": "In 1897, 8-year-old Virginia O’Hanlon famously wrote the New York Sun newspaper to ask if that “jolly old elf” was in fact real. One would think the now-classic, “Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus” response settled the matter once and for all. Sadly, that was not to be, for by 1927 there were enough disbelieving children in Bloomington-Normal and the surrounding area to spur the mysterious explorer “Danny Dare” into action. From late November through December 22, The Pantagraph printed Danny’s adventure-filled dispatches as he undertook an arduous trek to the North Pole to meet Santa Claus. “The main thing is to FIND him and PROVE it and then there can never, never be any doubt again,” Danny wrote on Nov. 29 as he readied his expedition into the Great White North. With a secret map tied in oilskin and ten pounds of chocolate as sustenance, Danny traveled by rail, hydroplane, raft, dogsled and foot in search of Santa’s “Snow Hut Village.” His three-week “dash to the Northland” read like a Jack London story with its stoic aboriginal people, fur traders, snarling, snapping wolves and forbidding landscape of ice and snow. In Toronto (or so the dateline read), Danny bumped into French-Canadian woodsman Jacque Valiant, an old friend from his army days who offered the services of his hydroplane. In Gogama, Ontario, on the shores of Lake Minisinakwa, Danny and Jacque met Joe Leflamme, a trapper whose sled was pulled not by Siberian huskies or Alaskan Malamutes but rather six untamed wolves! When Danny attempted to photograph the lead wolf “Valiant” (named for Jacque), the wild beast escaped his pen and disappeared into the snowy backcountry. Would Valiant be seen again, readers were left to wonder. During his many wild and wooly adventures Danny diligently filed dispatches for The Pantagraph, many of which inexplicably ran the same day they were written. Danny was careful to share more than a few facts he picked up along the way, which were heretofore unknown to many midwestern schoolchildren. For instance, Danny was told that in the North Country, “Santa wears an extra bearskin or so, thrown over his red coat, and he has to keep a muffler around his face to keep his beard from freezing and breaking.” Despite the harshest of conditions, Danny plowed ahead, undeterred and thinking only of finding the Snow Hut Village and meeting Santa. In the wilderness settlement of Nakina, he encountered Joe Petersson and “Jerry,” who was Joe’s famous bloodhound “Jerry showed great excitement when I pulled the picture postcard of Santa Claus from my pocket,” Danny related. “Until then he had eyed me coldly, tugging at the chain in his mater’s hand.” Petersson (toting a Swedish army rifle, no less) and Danny then “plunged into the bush country” by constructing a raft and floating down the fast-moving, ice-choked Ogoki River. For food they relied on “herbs and roots and winter berries,” as well as Jerry’s ability to “scare up a rabbit.” Petersson also brought down a moose, and so the travelers (and one hopes Jerry as well!) dined on fresh moose steaks. Upon reaching a camp of full-blooded Ojibwas, Joe turned back while Danny continued northward Yet Danny should’ve known better than to travel that far north all alone, without the companionship and protection of man or dog. And sure enough, he was set upon by a pack of hungry wolves. And it looked like the end for our brave correspondent until another wolf appeared as if out of nowhere to beat back the attackers and save Danny’s hide. “It was Valiant!” Danny shouted, the prized wolf who had escaped Joe Leflamme’s cage several weeks earlier. Although Danny dodged certain death, he and his enigmatic canine protector now found themselves lost and with little hope, and they could do little but stumble exhausted into an abandoned cabin. Meanwhile, The Pantagraph reported Danny missing as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, among others, organized search parties. But just when it seemed as if this fairy tale adventure would end in tragedy, Danny’s byline reappeared in the December 21 Pantagraph. He was alive! And with Santa! Unbeknownst to the Mounties or anyone else, Danny had been rescued from the bleak cabin by none other than St. Nick, who was out for a midnight spin on his sleigh, getting his eight reindeer (this was more than a decade before Rudolph made his debut) in shape for the big night ahead. In Danny’s telling, Snow Hut Village (see accompanying image) included Santa’s igloo residence, doll factory and toy workshop, while the North Pole was marked with “the biggest Christmas tree you ever saw, all hung with spangles and bangles and little lights and candy canes and things like that.” He further reported that, true to the legend, the “clever old chap” (that is, Santa) “hears just about everything.” In fact, the Beloved Bearded One told Danny of a girl on Mulberry Street in Bloomington who had the impudence the day before to answer “I won’t” when asked to do something by her mother. Danny stayed at the North Pole but one day, though not before befriending Inuit kindergartener Jimmy Wugah, who was serving as Santa’s official candy taster. Santa Claus also told Danny that he would pay Bloomington a visit on Friday, December 23, for the Children’s Christmas Jubilee held at the Illini Theater. This ambitious event involved activities such as a Christmas carol sing-along and a short play staged by the Junior Dramatic Club. And then there was Santa himself, straight from the Snow Hut Village, handing out socks filled with candy to each and every child. And after that, it was back to the North Pole to get ready for the toy-filled, globe-spanning sleigh ride on Christmas Eve.",

    "content": "In the late 1800s, there was no better place in Bloomington to grumble about the “gov’ment,” debate the issues of the day, recount a well-worn tale of pioneer pluck, or simply doze away the afternoon, than Adam’s Ark, a cigar store on the Courthouse Square. “The Ark,” it was said, was a place where “anecdote and repartee poured out like Old Crow from a stone jug at an old-fashioned barn raising.” It was an all-male mecca for retired politicians, old farmers, bank and shop clerks, Courthouse employees and the usual coterie of loafers and eccentrics with a gift for gab. They and other sorted hangers-on liked to gather around the “tobacco-bespattered stove” to tackle the unsolvable problems of the world. The cigar shop was known for its informal debates over matters ranging from the weighty to the trivial. “It was there that the great affairs of state were settled,” observed The Pantagraph in 1924, “presidents made and unmade, governors nominated and thrown out of office, congressmen and senators selected and cast aside and all of the county, township and municipal affairs adjusted.” The Adam in Adam’s Ark was Adam Guthrie. Born in 1825 in Ohio, Guthrie was a wee bitty thing when his family settled in McLean County, first in the Funks Grove area and then north of Towanda. The family eventually moved to Bloomington—that was in either 1831 or 1832 (accounts differ)—and it was here that Guthrie lived out the remainder of his long life. During the Civil War—this well before his cigar shop-owning days—he enlisted in the 94th Regiment Illinois Volunteer Infantry, participating in the Battle of Prairie Grove in Arkansas before being discharged due to illness. Guthrie first worked as a plasterer before embarking in the retail tobacco trade. Around 1880, he began running a cigar shop out of the storefront of a two-story building on the corner of Main and Jefferson streets (see accompanying photograph.) The ramshackle affair was the last wood-frame building on the Courthouse Square when it was lost in the Great Fire of June 19, 1900. “Adam Guthrie is the Noah to the Bloomington Ark and devotes his time to umpiring debates and selling cigars, fine cut and navy twist, to the chair-warmers,” remarked The Bulletin, a gone-but-not-forgotten Bloomington daily paper. “Everybody knew him,” related his grandson, the Rev. Sidney A. Guthrie. “He stood six feet, was slender, and had a full white beard. He wore a black frock coat until he died.” The Ark became a favorite gathering place for early settlers—“the rendezvous for the pioneers who toast their shins at the stove and tell pipe stories.” Frequent visitors included Bloomington mayor Benjamin F. Funk; John Dawson (the first Euro-American settler born in McLean County); Abram Brokaw (the “Bro” in BroMenn); and “Private” Joseph W. Fifer, a former governor. “When arguments grew too acrimonious,” read one of many reminiscences of The Ark, “old Adam started scrubbing the floor and made the disputants scatter.” Told and retold were the pioneer tales of hardihood and foolhardiness, involving the likes of wolves, prairie fires and meteorological calamities, such as the “Deep Snow” of 1830-1831, and the “Sudden Freeze” of 1836. At The Ark, someone quipped, the Deep Snow “got deeper every year.” From time to time on slow news days, a Pantagraph scribe would stroll over to Guthrie’s shop in search of a good story to fill a column of newsprint. “Yesterday was a dull day about town and there was a quorum at Adam’s Ark,” noted one such reporter in early January 1894. “Adam dozed peacefully in the corner behind the stove, occasionally waking from his nap long enough to object to some reckless statement of fact.” That day “Uncle” Ike Lash told a story of two men walking through some timber near Tremont when one aimed and fired a rifle at a sapsucker in a nearby tree. “There was a sort o’ whizzin’ and snappin’ in the timber for a second or two, and blamed if that feller that was standin’ beside the man that fired the gun didn’t fall dead in his tracks, with a rifle ball in the back of his head,” Lash relayed. “That consarned rifle ball had jest glanced from the sugar saplin’ to another, and then to another until it made a clean circle.” How, exactly, did Uncle Ike know this story to be true? Well, he said, he knew someone who just so happened to be the brother-in-law of someone who just so happened to witness the accident from afar. After the 1900 fire, Guthrie relocated his business to the Main Street side of the still-standing Evans Building, north of his old location. Even in his later years, Guthrie was known for his steel-trap mind, especially when it came to the past—he was called “an animated encyclopedia of doings in early times.” Adam Guthrie passed away in September 1904 at the age of 79, and not long after, the Ark closed its doors for good. In 1894, journalist and diarist Edward Wilson penned an appreciation of Adam’s Ark and its role in the local cultural landscape. In a poem, Wilson writes from the perspective of a local farmer who “don’t care a cent to go visitin’” Bloomington “exceptin,’” that is, Adam’s Ark. I’m jest a plain sort of a feller A stumpin’ around on the farm. … on long rainy days, ‘er in winter, When the cronies ‘er there, I’ll remark, That no matter how hard blows the blizzard, It’s all homelike at Adam’s Ark.",

    "content": "Back in the 19th century when miracle pills, plasters, creams, powders and tonics promised to cure all—from mild indigestion to pancreatic cancer—there were few patent medicine entrepreneurs as intriguing as Rebecca Keck. The fiercely independent “Dr. Mrs. Keck” (as she was almost always called) promised that her herbal concoctions would eradicate innumerable chronic diseases and conditions, including asthma, consumption (tuberculosis) and even blindness. By the early 1880s, Keck’s sprawling medical practice centered on her “Palatial Infirmary for All Chronic Diseases,” a converted mansion in the heart of Davenport, Ia. In addition, she operated “branch offices” in downstate Illinois communities such as Bloomington, Peoria and Quincy, where she made regularly scheduled stops. “Her medicines are sent all over the country and her name is a household word in families many hundreds of miles away,” noted the Bloomington Leader newspaper in 1881. Keck was best known for her remedy for “catarrh,” a 19th century term encompassing a wide range of respiratory ailments. At its height, her mail-order business was said to reach anywhere from 12,000 to 15,000 patients. Keck considered herself an “eclectic” physician, or one who emphasized herbal or botanical remedies, which were usually bottled and sold as tonics. As such, she was often at odds with the increasingly powerful and patriarchal “allopathic” (meaning modern and scientific) medical establishment. What’s often forgotten today is the promise such eclectic practitioners (and even outright quacks of the snake oil variety) held for sick and long-suffering patients of the 19th century. After all, at this time allopathic physicians often resorted to “heroic” treatments involving noxious or outright poisonous dosages of lead, mercury and the like. Similarly, surgery was often little more than a crude and ineffective horror show. Keck got her start in the medical trade as a housewife living in rural southeastern Iowa. When her husband’s foundry shop went under during the Panic of 1873, Rebecca, known in her community as an accomplished herbalist, began selling her homemade catarrh remedy to friends, neighbors, and nearby town and country folk. Although Keck’s education likely didn’t go beyond the eighth grade, she proved an adept businesswoman in the rough-and-tumble patent medicine industry. A few short years after the Panic of 1873 she was advertising her catarrh cure in newspapers as far away as Chicago. Much of what we know about this fascinating and mostly forgotten story comes from Greta Nettleton, a Keck descendant who inherited several trunks and bankers boxes containing correspondence, photographs, scrapbooks and other material from one of Rebecca’s daughters, the precocious and independent-minded Cora. Several years ago, Nettleton wrote the award-winning book, The Quack’s Daughter: A True Story about the Private Life of a Victorian College Girl. Nettleton is now working on a book on Rebecca Keck herself, and was kind enough to share some of her current research with this author. In 1877, the Illinois state legislature passed the Medical Practices Act in an attempt to establish some order out of the chaos of 19th century medical education, certification and regulation. The Illinois State Board of Health, led by its secretary, Dr. John H. Rauch, aggressively targeted physicians such as Keck, who he deemed unworthy of the profession because they lacked formal medical education. As both an itinerant, eclectic practitioner and a woman, Keck faced a steeper climb than most to gain a semblance of respect and recognition within the wider medical community. Nettleton says that while the drive to professionalize the ranks of doctors eliminated “bogus diploma mills, outright frauds, incompetents, and traveling medicine shows,” it also aimed at seizing “control of women’s health care by outlawing midwives, marriage counselors, birth control providers and abortionists.” For her part, Keck did not shy away from indentifying herself as a medical doctor—and a female one at that! She boasted that her remedies were based on “an entirely new principle, and though discovered by a woman and never thought of or applied by professional men … yet has the most essential principles and scientific truths underlying it.” In early 1876, Keck began seeing patients in Bloomington, which back then was a regional center for patent medicine manufacturers. The most successful was Cyrenius Wakefield, whose nationally distributed Blackberry Balsam was used to treat diarrhea and other bowel complaints. Wakefield operated a factory to compound, formulate and package Blackberry Balsam and his many other remedies, as well as a sizable printing operation to churn out hundreds of thousands (and even millions) of promotional giveaways such as almanacs filled with glowing testimonials as to the curative powers of the Wakefield line of medicines. Nettleton’s research tells us that Wakefield was a mentor to Keck, and that the two families were friends. And there is good indication that Wakefield bottled and shipped the bulk of Keck-labeled remedies from Bloomington. The two entrepreneurs, Rebecca Keck and Cyrenius Wakefield, had much in common, observes Nettleton. For instance, both were “frontier naturopaths” well versed in herbal lore who “felt the sting of contempt from the brotherhood of regular physicians.” In February 1878, an unidentified local physician confronted a visiting Keck at her Bloomington office, demanding to see her state credentials. Keck answered back that her attorney, Winfield Coy of Bloomington, handled all such calls. “The demand being made upon the attorney, he [Coy] replied that when he was compelled by process of law to produce the certificate, it would be forthcoming—until then, never!” reported the Bloomington Leader.” “We expect this is the beginning of a long and tedious litigation between the ‘regulars’ and the ‘irregulars’ (that is, allopathic versus alternative practitioners) and the public will await the result with interest.” Indeed, between 1878 and 1889, Keck appeared in court for practicing without a license at least five times in Illinois. But Dr. Mrs. Keck would not be denied. “She paid large fines but continued to practice, advertise and sell her remedies,” notes Nettleton. Rebecca Keck passed away in 1904 at the age of 66, having only retired four years earlier. Say what you will about Keck’s miracle cures, her unconquerable spirit was in many ways miracle enough. “While Mrs. Dr. Keck is a very pleasant and genial lady, she has a plucky and indomitable disposition, which is the admiration of all who know her and the terror of all who attack her,” declared the Bloomington Leader in 1881. “Despite her womanhood, which ought to exempt her from the shafts of masculine malice, she has been the victim of malignant and unjustifiable abuse from the regular male profession. But such prosecution has only fanned the flames of her widening reputation. In all such professional controversies Mrs. Dr. Keck has proved herself more than a match for her enemies.”",

    "content": "For many years, a dilapidated wood frame residence on the east edge of downtown Bloomington offered a visible reminder of the city’s earliest days. As a matter of fact, the Stipp house (as it was popularly known) was older than the city itself. The home’s first owner was not Dr. George Winfield Stipp, its namesake, but rather James Allin, the founder of Bloomington. In 1829, Allin moved to what would become Bloomington, and the following year he constructed a “dogtrot” log cabin, that is, a cabin featuring an open breezeway bookended by two rooms. Little did Allin know, but this rather unremarkable though eminently practical cabin would survive into the early 20th century to become the “ancient and historical” (in the words of The Pantagraph) Stipp house. Back in the early 1830s, Allin played an instrumental role in the creation of McLean County, offering some 20 acres of land just northwest of his place for the purpose of a county seat. Allin and his family lived in one room of the cabin, and he ran a store from the other room. The cabin was located on what would become the 200 Block of East Grove Street. In May 1831, a post office opened in the store-side of the Allin cabin, and in September of the same year, several months after Bloomington was platted and the first town lots sold, the county’s inaugural court session was held there. The Allin cabin, though, did not serve as the McLean County courthouse for long. In 1832, the county paid for the construction of a modest frame structure of whipsawn cherry and black walnut to be located the Courthouse Square. Even so, Allin’s cabin continued to be used as a residence, place of business and public meetinghouse. Asahel Gridley, another city father, eventually bought Allin’s combination house / store, and it’s said that Gridley was the one who added the second story. Through the subsequent decades the house was subjected to untold additions and alterations, both minor and extensive, and the old dogtrot was eventually buried inside a much larger frame structure (see accompanying photograph). Dr. George Stipp, a charter member of the McLean County Medical Society and medical inspector during the Civil War, purchased the residence in the mid-1850s. At that time, it was a quarter century old and had most recently served as a boarding house. After a “long and tedious illness,” Stipp died in August 1879. His second wife, Sarah W. Harris, lived in the increasingly neglected home before moving into the Illinois Hotel (now House) on the courthouse square. By the spring of 1903, the Bloomington City Council entertained a discussion about tearing down the old house and outbuildings. Its historical significance notwithstanding, the council believed the collection of ramshackle buildings on the weedy, overgrown lot presented not only a fire hazard, but a “menace to the welfare of the entire community.” The following year, in 1904, a Pantagraph reporter visited the now-abandoned Stipp house, which by then was in a truly awful state of disrepair. Much of the front porch, which had once run the length of the house, had collapsed, and the roof and walls were pockmarked with holes. “Weather boarding has been stripped from the rear of the building,” the Pantagrapher added, “and great gaps … afford peeping holes for the curious.” The anonymous reporter crawled through one of the larger openings in back to take readers on a tour of the city’s oldest house. Much of the Stipp family furniture and personal belongings were still inside, though thieves had removed the silverware and other valuables. In the kitchen, the reporter noticed an “old cook stove, part of it gone and the rest covered in rust.” On the floor of the dining room was an “old wooden clock disemboweled and the works rusted lying on the carpet.” The sitting room included a low davenport covered in black horsehair, a gold-framed mirror still hanging on the wall and a center table with a marble top. The parlor featured a busted piano, legless stool and an upholstered chair upon which rested a piece of sheet music titled “Just Before the Battle Mother.” The old house was taken down not long after the reporter’s bittersweet walkthrough. Fortunately, bits and pieces of the home were saved by the historic minded or plain curious. Oscar Burtschi, for instance, salvaged a part of the black walnut stairwell to make several “handsomely turned and polished” gavels, which he gave to three local Masonic lodges. Sarah Stipp passed away in May 1917, and several years later, Ida Hanna, a daughter from Stipp’s first marriage, gave the historic property to the county. In 1921, the Board of Supervisors (the predecessor to the County Board) decided to erect a veteran’s memorial building on the lot. John McBarnes, an aged farmer from Old Town Township, donated $150,000 for the construction of this building. In March 1922, workers felled ten magnificent, pre-settlement elm and bass trees from the Stipp property in order to make way for the planned John McBarnes Memorial Building. By this time, these towering, old-growth trees were one of the few survivors within city limits of what was once a 6,000-acre forested tract known as Blooming Grove. Around this time, Bloomington resident N.W. Brandicon noted how the Stipp grounds were relatively undisturbed, and that a mere blocks from the courthouse square and the central business district a wild remnant of the prairie grove remained intact. Here “spring beauties” and other wildflowers found mostly in natural areas grew in profusion. When the Stipp house was taken down, the pioneer-era logs were salvaged and removed to the zoo at Miller Park, with the intention of reconstructing the old cabin for use as an historic attraction. “The [park] commissioners said they would rebuild the log cabin sometime—when they had the spare money. But that day never came,” said Mary Bomgardner, widow of longtime park custodian Edward Bomgardner, in a 1929 interview. “Consequently, the logs and other material simply rotted away on the ground back of the bear den . . . Finally, as I recall, Alderman Maurice McCarthy took the matter up in the council and got through a resolution that the old stuff be carted away or burned up, so that it did not encumber the ground any longer.”",

    "content": "Fifty years ago this week—April 27, 1968—Bloomington officials held a groundbreaking ceremony for the city’s second lake. On that day, Mayor Robert McGraw also announced the name of this new $5 million, 700-acre, 4.2 billion gallon reservoir—it was to be called Evergreen Lake. When completed in 1972, the lake, situated fifteen miles north of Bloomington, doubled the city’s available water supply. Evergreen serves as a younger “twin” to Lake Bloomington, which was built in 1929-1930 and is located five miles to the east. By the 1960s, the city’s continued growth made it increasing difficulty to meet long-term water needs, especially during drought years. Both lakes, Bloomington and Evergreen, were formed by impounding tributaries of the Mackinaw River —Money Creek and Six Mile Creek respectively. During its planning and early construction phase, Evergreen was first called Six Mile Lake, which made sense, geographically speaking. Nonetheless, and for reasons unknown, Mayor McGraw and the city council decided a new appellation was in order, and so they staged a name-the-lake contest in the spring of 1968. Some 315 names were submitted to the city, including eventual winner Evergreen Lake, suggested independently by Bernice Beadles of Bloomington, and Carol Myers, an Illinois State University sophomore from Champaign. Beadles said the name made sense because Bloomington was long known as the “Evergreen City” (a nickname that in the ensuing half-century has fallen out of favor). The two women split the $100 prize money. In addition, there were, shall we say, more intriguing suggestions, including Stevenson Lake and Lake Adlai, both named for Bloomington’s favorite son, Adlai E. Stevenson II. Other names included Land of Lincoln Lake, David Davis Lake, Twin Lake, Lake Hudson and Lake Sesquicentennial (Illinois celebrated 150 years of statehood in 1968). Several of the more imaginative names included Asahikawa Lake (after Bloomington’s sister city in Japan), and Frank Breen Lake (a minister who helped establish Western Avenue Community Center and East Bay Camp at Lake Bloomington). Some submissions were intentionally comic, such as Lake Necessity, Lake Bloomington Junior (or LBJ) and Ferguson’s Folly, after Donald Ferguson, Bloomington’s director of engineering and water. And some folks insisted on combining Bloomington with Normal, even though the latter had nothing whatsoever to do with the lake—financially, statutorily, or otherwise. These proto-BloNo suggestions included Normington and the unwieldy McNorBloo. Regardless, the city’s second “soft water reservoir” ended up with the name Evergreen Lake, with “Evergreen” preceding “lake.” On the other hand, it’s Lake Bloomington, with “lake” preceding “Bloomington.” The explanation for this oppositional nomenclature remains a mystery—at least to this writer! Construction of Evergreen Lake was made possible through passage of a $2 million general obligation bond, approved by city residents on April 4, 1967, by a vote of 3,508 to 2,533. Construction bids were opened the following spring. Land acquisition and engineering fees, among other additional costs, increased the lake’s final price tag to a tad over $5 million, or the equivalent of $30 million in today’s dollars, adjusted for inflation. The earthen dam and spillway to impound Six Mile Creek and control the lake level were big ticket items, together costing nearly $2 million. When first completed, the lake’s dam featured a 60-foot spillway that required some 19,000 yards of poured concrete. The new lake also included a $343,000 pumping station and a $571,000 water main of 30-inch ductile iron pipe running from Evergreen Lake to Lake Bloomington’s water purification plant (the water main runs parallel to Lake Bloomington Road, which connects the two manmade bodies of water). Some 70 folks attended the April 27, 1968 groundbreaking program on the floor of the future lakebed (see accompanying photograph). “The groundbreaking ceremony was simple, quick and to the point,” noted Pantagraph reporter Bill Wills. “Most of the spectators were city officials and contractors.” The program was purely ceremonial, with work already well underway, as the speakers found themselves competing for the crowd’s attention with earthmoving equipment busily at work in the background. By this time, a large-scale logging effort had already removed about one-third of the timber in the stretch of the Six Mile Creek floodplain slated for inundation. Lake Evergreen impoundment began on Jan. 11, 1971, with officials estimating they’d reach “full pool,” 715 feet above sea level, in two year’s time. Yet the process went much quicker than anticipated, and the lake hit the 715-foot mark almost exactly one year later—Jan. 10, 1972. Although Evergreen Lake is owned by the City of Bloomington, a long-term lease agreement gives the County of McLean the authority to plan, develop and operate the lake and surrounding shoreline, parkland and natural areas, including the section poking into Woodford County. For more than four decades, Comlara Park (the unique name is an acronym for County of McLean Lake and Recreation Area), situated along the serpentine lake’s northeastern shore, has remained the hub of Evergreen Lake activities. After a series of delays, the public beach at Comlara opened in August 1975. A second beach, proposed for the lake’s western shore, never got beyond the planning stages. Other hoped-for park, recreation and heritage plans for Evergreen Lake that remain on the drawing board include an observation tower, working farm museum, ecological research center and youth camp. In the mid-1990s, officials raised the height of the dam to add some 225 additional acres of surface water. The increase in capacity was deemed necessary to ensure Bloomington’s long-term access to a safe and dependable water supply. Today, the now 925-acre Evergreen Lake offers some of the best fishing, boating and camping in Central Illinois. The Illinois Department of Natural Resources stocks the lake with muskie and saugeye, as good an indication as any as to the high-quality sporting experience awaiting anglers, amateur and expert alike. There are also 137 camping sites, from primitive to RV-ready, as well as two boat launches and a third one for canoes. “Although the groundbreaking was a relatively quiet affair,” noted The Pantagraph’s Bill Wills, back in April 1968, “it’ll surely go down in the city’s history as a major step toward progress.”",

    "content": "The holiday season of 1900 brought more changes than usual for area shoppers flocking to downtown Bloomington. A little more than six months earlier, on the night of June 19, 1900, a fire that began in the Model Laundry building on East Monroe Street quickly spread south and westward engulfing, in a few cataclysmic hours, 45 buildings and reducing 4½ square blocks of downtown to smoking rubble. Losses included the original Wolf Griesheim clothing store and office building, one of the larger downstate commercial buildings of its kind; dozens more retailers both large and small; the supposedly “fireproof” McLean County Courthouse built in 1868; and the Windsor, the city’s largest hotel. With the arrival of the holiday season a large swath of downtown Bloomington resembled a construction site. Even so, the “burnt district” included a fair number of completed or nearly completed buildings, which meant there was surprisingly little disruption for downtown shoppers during the first Christmas after the Great Bloomington Fire. A traveling salesman from St. Louis stopped in Bloomington on Nov. 30 on his first visit to the “Evergreen City” (Bloomington’s once-popular nickname) since the fire. “He was astonished at the immense amount of building that was going on at the present time,” reported The Pantagraph. “He said that he believed there was not another city in the country the size of Bloomington where as much energy would be displayed after a catastrophe of the kind that visited this city June 19.” The new six-story Griesheim Building, located on the site of its burned-out predecessor at Main and Jefferson streets, was almost finished by the holiday season. A formal opening of the building was held Dec. 11, though much work continued on the floors of professional offices above the street-level retail space. In a way the fire proved fortuitous in that modern commercial buildings, some featuring steel framing and large plate glass storefronts, replaced those that were lost to the flames. As such, Bloomington architects George H. Miller and Arthur L. Pillsbury played a leading role reshaping downtown for the 20th century. According to one estimate, something like 12 to 14 million bricks from local manufacturers went into rebuilding downtown during the summer of 1900. Finer, high-quality brick from St. Louis and elsewhere, shipped by rail to Bloomington, was mainly used for the outer “courses” (or layers) of the walls. The more inexpensive local brick was used for the inner courses. By Dec. 17, workers had finished the ornate terra cotta frieze and decorative cornice of the Col. D.C. Smith Building, 313 N. Main St. (it’s home to several art galleries today.) With this work complete the entire block of 300 North Main Street, running from Jefferson to Monroe, was now rebuilt—a mere six months removed from the Great Fire. Downtown remained a hive of construction activity late into the holiday season. On Dec. 23, carpenters were busy putting in the joists on the second floor of the Braley Building, located at the corner of Center and Jefferson streets (Maguire’s Bar & Grill occupies the first floor today). It was this tireless pace of reconstruction that made the 1900 Christmas season a success. “Merchants are pretty well satisfied with the amount that has come into their doors,” reported The Pantagraph on Christmas Eve. “There has been generous buying, and depleted stocks of goods are the rule, not the exception.” The Pantagraph took a crack at estimating the amount of money spent in the Twin Cities on holiday gifts and “feastings,” and in doing so conservatively figured $2.50 for every man, woman and child. Although that seems like a trifle, $2.50 in inflation-adjusted dollars is the equivalent of more than $70 today. Come to think of it … maybe that isn’t so much after all, at least compared to the hyper-consumerism of today! “The day comes but once a year,” The Pantagraph said of Christmas back in 1900, “and the joys of it will more than balance the depleted pocketbooks and upset stomachs on the morrow.” Christmas Day brought picture-perfect weather, at least as far as Santa and his reindeer were concerned. “The day was a typical one for the season,” noted The Pantagraph, “being cold and crisp, with snow falling at frequent enough intervals to remind one of winter’s reign.” The city did not roll up its sidewalks for Christmas, which fell on a Tuesday that year. Some shops opened for several hours in the morning to accommodate panicky buyers, though candy stores kept their doors open for much of the day. U.S. letter carriers worked until 9:30 a.m., while Bloomington & Normal Railway employees kept the intercity streetcars running from the pre-dawn to late evening hours. Likewise, many telephone and telegraph operators faced the regular “weekday grind.” McLean County Sheriff George Johnson’s wife Carrie was probably busier than most on Christmas Day, seeing that she provided a home-cooked turkey dinner for all jail inmates. Prisoners also received three cigars, a handkerchief, candy, popcorn, nuts and a card signed by the Johnsons wishing them a merry Christmas and happy New Year. Yes, downtown was back one half year after the Great Fire, though there was still much work to do. Three days after Christmas, masons laid the first stone for the walls of the new courthouse. Formal dedication would come on Sep. 24, 1903. Today, this magnificent building, which remains the heart of historic downtown, is home to the McLean County Museum of History. Back in 1900, the big local news was the Christmas Day arrest in Chicago of “Bloomington Red,” a notorious thief known for his taste in expensive silks (as in stealing—rather than wearing—them.) “Red,” who employed various aliases but whose real name was said to be John Murray, was wanted in Ottawa and Quincy, Ill.; Elkhart and LaPorte, Ind.; Beloit and Janesville, Wis.; Dubuque, Ia.; and other locales near and far. Bloomington served as his base of operations for quite a while, though during his time here he was known as “Red Summers.” When arrested in Chicago, Bloomington Red had some $3,000 worth in silks pilfered during his recent foray to Quincy, as well as a roll of nine $100 bills in his pocket (or the equivalent of about $26,000 today). “He had evidently come to Chicago to celebrate the holiday season,” it was said.",

    "content": "One would be hard pressed to come up with a more iconic image of the Corn Belt than the old wood barn. It’s also an endangered remnant of a lost world, as the number of 19th and early 20th century horse, dairy and cattle barns has been in steep decline for the past half century or more. But unlike the bald eagle, it’s unlikely the endangered wood barn will ever make a comeback. As their numbers dwindle, saving them has drawn increased attention from farmers, preservationists, and folks who just love the beauty of these sentinels of the Central Illinois countryside. There are various ways to assess the loss of barns in McLean County. For example, there are 50-plus detailed illustrations of local farmsteads in the Atlas of McLean County, published in 1874 (see accompanying illustration), and some 90 such views in the 1887 Portrait and Biographical Album of McLean County. Yet of the several hundred barns depicted in these two works, only a handful—if even that—remain standing today. Generally speaking, the 19th century barn housed horses and other livestock, but also served as a granary, storehouse, and workshop. Such all-purpose farm buildings were well-suited to the diverse nature of farming back then. What then happened to these barns, as well as the hundreds upon hundreds of others built in the first half of the 20th century? Well, most fell prey to their own obsolescence, in that they proved ill-suited to the cold efficiencies and brute power of the machine age and cash grain farming. Mother Nature, though, has also had her hand in bringing down plenty of barns over the years. Tornadoes come naturally to mind, though lightning strikes were long the single greatest threat to farm buildings. To cite a representative example, on the night of June 11-12, 1929, lightning from a severe thunderstorm claimed a substantial barn on the P.R. Nord farm four miles southwest of Bloomington. Losses, which included tools, machinery, harnesses and “large quantities” of hay and straw, were estimated at $10,000 (or the equivalent of more than $143,000 today, adjusted for inflation). Although lightning played a dramatic—dare we say electrifying?—role in the loss of barns, of far greater consequence, as mentioned above, were the sweeping changes entailed in the mechanization of the Corn Belt. With the disappearance of horses by the 1940s, and the arrival of ever-larger machines, especially corn pickers and then combines, many old barns became obsolete. Their low ceilings, small doors (comparatively speaking), built-in stalls and other features proved ill-suited to modern industrial-scale farming. Pole barns and machine shed now dominate the Midwestern countryside, and although they are indispensible to the continued success of Corn Belt farming, they lack the individuality and often simple beauty of their older counterparts. The loss of area barns in the latter half of the 20th century can be measured with some degree of accuracy. In 1955, the Loree Co. published a reference work titled This Is McLean County, which features more than 700 pages of aerial views of most every farmstead in the county (other counties, such as Livingston and Woodford, received the same treatment). By totaling up the number of barns depicted in this book (and leaving out corn cribs, silos, machine sheds and other larger outbuildings), one learns that there were something like 4,500 barns in McLean County in the mid-1950s. In 2002, Barn Keepers, a local not-for-profit organization dedicated to the promotion, documentation and preservation of area barns, traveled to every corner of McLean County with the purpose of counting and photographing each and every barn in the county. The decline in the number of barns since 1955 was staggering. Barn Keepers counted 1,200 barns in 2002, a decline of almost three-quarters in less than a half century. In addition, dozens of barns have been lost since the 1950s when Bloomington-Normal began gobbling up acre upon acre of surrounding farmland for seemingly unchecked commercial and residential sprawl. It’s even happened in the smaller towns. In the spring of 1990, a backhoe unceremoniously razed the lovely Schertz barn on the east edge of Danvers. Erected around 1925, the dairy barn featured glazed ceramic tile half walls and a matching tile silo. The barn was torn down to make way for the new Briarwood subdivision. The National Barn Alliance views old barns as “cultural resources and heritage assets that are vital to understanding the history of our nation … irreplaceable and worthy of preservation.” There are local groups who embrace this philosophy, including the Barn Keepers and the good folks at the Barn Quilt Heritage Trail—McLean County. Barn restoration, though, is difficult and expensive, and most farmers are understandably too busy to confront all the potential impracticalities—financial or otherwise—entailed in such efforts. That said, no one treasures old barns more than farmers, as they usually grew up working in them, all the while listening to their parents and grandparents tell stories about them—what they were used for, how that use changed over time, and even the playful mischief and occasional misfortune that occurred in and around them. Although the need is great, there is little public or private money available to help farmers and other owners save their barns. There’s a federal income tax credit for barn rehabilitation, for instance, but the barn must have been in use prior to 1936 or registered or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. And this tax credit only pays for a percentage of the rehabilitation costs. Given that the price tag for restoring a single barn can easily reach into the tens of thousands of dollars (if not six-figure territory) even well-intentioned programs are non-starters for many barn owners. Lacking big bucks for preservation grants and the like, groups like the Bloomington-based Barn Keepers often concentrate on educating the public about the need to preserve old barns. Along those lines, the Barn Keepers annual barn tour is Sat., Sept. 9, from 9 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., out and about Hudson Township. Registration begins at 9:00 a.m. at the Hudson United Methodist Church. Tickets are $15 per car for Barn Keepers members, and $20 for non-members. This is the group’s eleventh annual tour in McLean County. Tour participants will receive a booklet with information on each barn, as well as a map to make sure no one gets lost! Upon registering, tour participants are on their own and free to visit the farms at any pace, and in any order, they choose. In 1955, Hudson Township was home to around 165 barns. The 2002, the Barn Keepers survey turned up only 37. And in the decade-and-a-half since then there have been additional losses. Such dire numbers and the future they foretell led one local resident to ask a Barn Keepers board member just how long they’ll be able to keep staging their annual barn tour. In a decade or two, it was asked, will there be enough barns around to hold a tour?",

    "content": "On August 26, 1920, U.S. Secretary of State Bainbridge Colby signed into law the 19th Amendment granting women the right to vote. The intentionally muted signing ceremony—held at Colby’s personal residence no less—marked the end of an arduous journey toward women’s suffrage dating to the anti-slavery movement in the decades before the Civil War. Bloomington was never a hotbed of suffragist sentiment, yet beginning in the early 1870s and through the next half century there existed on the local scene measured support for the enfranchisement of women. From time to time, Bloomington hosted lectures, debates, organizational meetings and conventions, all relating to suffrage. Furthermore, the pages of The Pantagraph and the city’s other newspapers were occasionally peppered with lively exchanges between those who supported and those who opposed (with men and women on both sides) the right of the “fairer sex” to vote. Illinois’ statehood constitution of 1818 limited voting to “white male inhabitants,” and the state’s third constitution (ratified in 1870) enlarged the franchise to include African-American males, though calls to expand that fundamental right to women fell on deaf ears. In March of that year, 1870, suffrage titan Susan B. Anthony debated Illinois State Normal University Professor Edwin C. Hewett before a packed crowd at Schroeder’s Opera House in downtown Bloomington. Almost two years later, February 1872, the Illinois Woman Suffrage Association held its convention at the same location. The statewide group’s executive committee featured three women from Bloomington—Barbara Prince, Jane Fell and Frances Hogg. Out-of-state speakers at this meeting included Mary Adelle Hazlett, the “little wolverine” from Michigan, and Susan Anthony, back once more and still tirelessly fighting the good fight. “She speaks like lightning and cuts and slashes in every direction,” The Pantagraph said of Anthony. Dr. Ellen B. Ferguson, a Bloomington physician and proto-feminist, inveighed against the principle of taxation without representation. She also spent part of her half hour speech denouncing the “frivolity of fashionable life.” Ferguson told the gathered suffragists that girls are “educated too much in the direction of finery and feathers and not enough in the direction of useful information and the knowledge of how to take care of themselves.” Preaching self-sufficiency, she said that many local girls could “grow up to be magnificent specimens of womanhood if they were to leave the realm of fashion.” By 1873, the Illinois legislature OK’d women to hold elected offices relating to public education, though they were still prevented from voting in these or any other races. Even so, by the following year Illinois could boast of having 10 female county school superintendents elected by male voters. Finally, in 1891, the Illinois General Assembly granted women the right to vote in school elections. As a result, the Monday, April 4, 1892, election of two Bloomington Board of Education members (though both male) marked the first time women could vote in the city. For its part, The Pantagraph called this historic event the “most remarkable, interesting, and in many respects exciting, election which has ever occurred in Bloomington.” With early morning rains threatening voter turnout, Mary Ward, “clad in gossamer and galoshes and holding a dripping umbrella,” became the first woman to cast a vote in a Bloomington election. By the time the weather improved, the line of first-time voters extended out the County Courthouse (where the segregated-by-sex ballot boxes were located) and down Main Street. “None of the lady voters yesterday smoked, chewed tobacco or drank whiskey while waiting in line,” The Pantagraph joked. “No wonder some people don’t want women to vote.” Women comprised nearly one-quarter of the electorate that day. “The gentle sex descended on that single ballot box like an avalanche,” concluded The Pantagraph. At long last, the landmark Illinois Municipal Voting Act of 1913 gave women the right to cast ballots in all elections not specifically referenced in the state constitution. This meant that Illinois was the first state east of the Mississippi River to allow women to vote in presidential contests. And on June 10, 1919, Illinois became the first state (beating Wisconsin by an hour) to ratify the 19th Amendment, which would end all remaining state roadblocks to full voting rights. In 1923, Lottie Holman O’Neill of the DuPage County community of Downers Grove became the first woman to serve in the Illinois House of Representatives, and two years later, Florence Fifer Bohrer (see accompanying image), a fellow Republican from Bloomington, became the first woman to occupy a seat in the state senate.",

    "content": "“Julia Scott Vrooman has always been in the news,” noted The Pantagraph in early October 1976. The occasion was her 100th birthday, held at her East Taylor Street home in which she was born and raised, and spent most of her adult life. Still spry of mind, if not so much of body, Vrooman recalled her role as a Washington, D.C. socialite during the Woodrow Wilson administration, when her husband Carl served as assistant secretary in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. At the end of the First World War, she then earned national attention for her charitable work in battle-scarred Europe, as she mostly traveled across occupied Germany to entertain homesick doughboys (as American soldiers were known) with “Mrs. Vrooman’s Jazz Band.” Julia Scott Vrooman’s life was one of privilege. Her father, Matthew T. Scott, founded the small McLean County community of Chenoa, and owned some 5,000 surrounding acres in northern McLean and southern Livingston counties. In 1872, Matthew and his wife, Julia Green Scott, moved to Bloomington, purchasing the residence at 701 E. Taylor St (now the Vrooman Mansion bed and breakfast). Their daughter Julia was born there in 1876. Eighteen years later, in 1894, the younger Julia met her future husband Carl Vrooman while making her “Grand Tour” of Europe. They were married in 1896, and would make their first of many return visits to Europe the following year. Well-educated and modestly wealthy with a shared independent streak, Julia and Carl lived a life forever on-the-go. Julia arrived in Europe in August 1918, having volunteered to work for the YMCA and its programs serving American soldiers. “I have no children,” she said at the time. “I am in perfect health. I am fortunate enough to be able to speak both French and Italian. If, instead of looking for an opportunity to get into war work, I were looking for an excuse to avoid it, I could not find one.” After training in England, she arrived in Paris just in time for the armistice. Yet she soon realized that the “long, dreary period” of occupation and demobilization meant that there was much work still to do, especially in the smaller and more isolated American camps with little recreational opportunities. As such, Vrooman spent the rest of 1918 and much of the following year visiting American soldiers, many of whom were stationed in occupied Germany. She became famous for traveling with her self-styled jazz band comprised of soldiers playing a ragged early ragtime before their fellow countrymen. “Where the boys did not have musical instruments they made them out of frying pans and other camp utensils,” quipped Vrooman. “It is surprising what a lot of music you can get out of string, stretched over a frying pan—if you adjust your ear to the music.” Jazz was a newly emerging style of American music given a cultural and commercial boost with the Great Migration of African Americans to northern cities such as Chicago and New York. During the war, the “colored” 15th New York Regiment’s band famously brought its ragtime to France, and this and similar efforts helped spread this distinctly American sound to other units, both black and white, as well as to Europeans across the continent. Vrooman also used her influence and personal resources to aid French civilians, eventually picking up the informal title, “The Apostle of the Lost Tribes.” Much to her frustration, it was impossible to keep a stable roster of band mates, given that their units were often on the move or being sent home. “We usually went out into the back districts where the boys seldom saw anybody but themselves,” Vrooman said. “In two different camps I found that the only pianist was in the guardhouse, and it was necessary to ‘borrow’ him from the captain for the occasion.” She also didn’t hesitate to ask for favors high up the chain of command. For instance, she said both Maj. Gen. Joseph E. Kuhn, commander of the 79th Division, and Marine Corps Gen. LeRoy P. Hunt, “put automobiles at my disposal and gave me the range of the camps.” The letters back to her mother also tell us that the indefatigable Vrooman was having the time of her life. In one such letter, written in July 1919 from Germany, she good naturedly criticized the local dinner fare. “Why will a German insist on cooking fresh string beans in vinegar, and seasoning their cabbage with cinnamon?” she asked. “However, I swallowed it for the definite purpose of nourishment—it was to furnish ‘beau coup’ steam to run the engine fast and hard that night.” But the war’s aftermath wasn’t all high adventure for Vrooman. The stench, figuratively speaking, of the millions of dead was never far away. “Paris is gay, but it is a surface gayety,” she reflected. “Every third woman you meet is in mourning.” Vrooman returned stateside in mid-December 1919 aboard the Holland-American passenger liner “Rotterdam.” According to press reports, “The Apostle for the Lost Tribes” brought an entire French family—husband, wife and two children—with her on the voyage. They had evidently lost everything in the war and were eager to start life anew. The “Rotterdam” battled a furiously violent winter storm much of the way, sheathing her in ice and leaving her forward rails “twisted and broken.” The ship’s captain said it was the worst storm he had ever seen on the Atlantic. Julia and Carl Vrooman continued to travel, though they always returned to Bloomington and their home on East Taylor Street. During the Great Depression, Eleanor Roosevelt paid a visit to Julia. The first lady then raved about her host’s whole wheat bread in her syndicated newspaper column, “My Day.” On May 30, 1981, Julia passed away in the same home she was born in 104 years earlier. Julia and Carl Vrooman are two of the eight featured individuals in this year’s Evergreen Cemetery Walk, which commemorates the centennial of World War I. Other historical characters include Carolyn Schertz Geneva, a Brokaw Hospital nurse who served in the Army Medical Unit in England, and Edward and Lincoln Bynum, African-American brothers who fought with the famed “Black Devils” regiment in the trenches of France and Belgium. Presented by the McLean County Museum of History, the Evergreen Cemetery Walk runs the next two weekends, Sept. 30-Oct. 1, and Oct.7-8. For ticket information, call the museum at 309-827-0428. Hurry, because tickets go fast, and sold out shows are not uncommon.",

    "content": "The not-for-profit McLean County Museum of History celebrates local history in all its complexities and in all sorts of ways. There are exhibits, collections, lectures, school programs, walking tours, bus trips, and a whole lot more. One unique way to explore the past is through the dramatic arts, including the museum’s popular Evergreen Cemetery Walk, normally staged each fall at Bloomington’s oldest and most historic cemetery. Unfortunately, what with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there won’t be much walking during this year’s cemetery walk. Instead, this “living history” event has been reimagined so it can still be enjoyed—albeit in a social-distancing manner from the safety of one’s home via a smartphone, tablet, laptop or PC. You’ll still get to meet the cast of historical characters and hear their stories, but instead of live, in-person theater, you’ll be watching professionally recorded performances online. One such compelling figure you’ll get to know virtually is Florence Mae Risser Funk. Born in Bloomington in 1871, Florence was uprooted six years later when her German-immigrant father Abraham Risser moved the family to Chicago to establish a successful saddlery business. Florence attended Vassar College in New York, and after returning to the Prairie State she married, in 1895, Frank H. Funk of Bloomington, whom she had known in her childhood. Frank Funk was the grandson of Isaac Funk, patriarch to the large and still-influential local family line. Frank’s father, Benjamin Franklin Funk, was a former Bloomington mayor and U.S. congressman. The newly married couple established their home at 907 N. McLean St. on the east side of Franklin Park. Their neighbor to their immediate north—the corner of McLean and Walnut streets—was Joseph W. “Private Joe” Fifer, a former Illinois governor. In 1924, Fifer’s daughter, Florence Fifer Bohrer, became the first woman elected to the Illinois State Senate. Frank and Florence Funk were from privileged backgrounds, yet they were both committed progressives who often sided with social activists and political and economic liberals. They were a far cry from rabble-rousers or anarchists, certainly, but in their own well-mannered Corn Belt way, they fought the good fight representing the reformist wing of the Republican Party. In Bloomington, Florence became active in all sorts of women’s societies, clubs, associations, teas, fellowships, and the like, including the Amateur Music Club, the History and Art Club, the YWCA and the Women’s Club. Faced with the enormous restrictions and limitations imposed by patriarchal America, Funk and many of her peers spurned a life of rigged domesticity, and instead devoted increasing time and energy to these social and service-oriented organizations that were beginning to address the urgent issues of the day—from public sanitation and education to suffrage. In 1912, Frank Funk ran as the Progressive Party candidate for Illinois governor. Although a lifelong Republican, he followed former President Theodore Roosevelt, who bolted the calcified GOP to lead likeminded reformers under the banner of the Progressive “Bull Moose” Party. As much as—or perhaps more than—her husband, Florence Funk championed progressive causes. To cite a representative example, she was active in the playground movement, as educators and welfare advocates embraced fresh air and organized play as essential to proper child development. In the spring of 1912, Funk delivered an illustrated address on playgrounds—complete with 100 slides—before the mother and parent clubs of several Bloomington schools. In this talk, she decried the inequality when it came to educational and recreational opportunities for children in the Twin Cities. While some schools boasted well-equipped playgrounds, others lacked basic necessities. “The schools where playgrounds are most needed are most neglected,” she noted. “If playgrounds are good for some children, why not good for all.” Funk came of age at a time when women did not have the constitutional right to vote. She was a local and state leader in the suffrage movement, serving as a delegate, for instance, to the Illinois Equal Suffrage Association convention of 1914. When the U.S. entered the World War in 1917, Florence Funk was well positioned to help organize and lead home front efforts. The Illinois Federation of Women’s Clubs, of which Funk was vice president, helped organize Council of Defense units throughout the state. These local councils served as a principal organizing force for the statewide war effort. Women such as Funk, noted the official history of McLean County and World War I, “were as truly, and as usefully, in the service of their country as were those who bore official titles or wore the nation’s uniform.” After the collapse of Teddy Roosevelt’s Bull Moose Party, Frank Funk returned to the Republican fold, serving three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. Early in his second term, Florence became gravely ill, passing away on Sep. 6, 1923, at the age of 51. At the time of her death, she was remembered as a “woman of liberal culture, energetic nature, of comprehensive views on all questions of public interest, and possessed of a large and sympathetic heart.” Learn all about Florence Funk and her role in the suffrage movement during this year’s Virtual Evergreen Cemetery Walk. The McLean County Museum of History, in partnership with Illinois Voices Theatre and Evergreen Memorial Cemetery, has created another first-rate historical and theatrical experience. In addition to Funk, this year’s walk features Grace Huddleston Stewart, who fought for fair housing in the Twin Cities during the 1960s. Household tickets are $25 (or $20 for museum members). The 26th annual cemetery walk can be viewed Oct. 3 through Nov. 2, with each ticket giving one the ability to watch all or parts of the virtual walk multiple times.

    "content": "Three months after Pearl Harbor and the U.S. entry into World War II, Normal residents found their attention momentarily turned to an undersized but tough-as-iron Normal Community High School boys’ basketball team as they made a deep run in the state tournament. Although a surprising “sweet sixteen” appearance in Champaign capped the 1941-42 season, the team didn’t catch fire until state tourney time. NCHS finished the regular season with 10-11 record, only to rattle off six straight wins to capture regional and sectional championships. They lost their one game at storied Huff Gymnasium on the University of Illinois campus, but the 16-12 “little” Ironmen headed back to the Twin Cities on Highway 150 with their heads held high, having made history with the school’s first appearance in the state basketball finals. “My main memory is the size of that team was amazing,” recalled Ed Alsene to Pantagraph reporter Douglas Hamm in a 2005 story on the 1941-42 season. “Their so-called forwards were 5-6 and 5-5 … That’s got to be the smallest team to ever play in Huff Gym in the state finals.” Back then, Alsene was one year out of NCHS and covering his alma mater as a sportswriter for The Pantagraph. The Ironmen, though quick and athletic, were often worn down by taller opponents. When they lost to Dwight 44-33 on Dec. 17, for instance, they spotted the visiting Trojans nearly six inches a man. Normal Community High itself was also small, at least enrollment-wise. At this time, NCHS competed in the Corn Belt Conference with U High, Pontiac, and others, and not in the Big 12 with the likes of Bloomington and the big city schools of Peoria. The Ironmen were coached by Ralph “Hap” Arends, who went on to serve as McLean County schools superintendant for nearly a quarter century. The “Orange and Black’s” leading scorer and most valuable player was forward Don “Andy” Anderson. Though standing 5-8, his speed and court smarts were something to see. Anderson picked up 15 varsity letters at NCHS, and it’s said he played a little football at both the U of I—all 128 pounds of him—and Illinois Wesleyan. The blonde junior patterned his high-arching, two-handed “kiss shot” after Centralia’s hard court wizard (and later Illini legend) Dwight “Dike” Eddleman. The year before, Anderson and a group of Normal boys drove all the way to Centralia to see the great Eddleman in a state tourney quarterfinal. “They put the ball right up at their nose and shot a two-handed shot,” is how Alsene described it. Anderson finished the year tops in Corn Belt scoring, becoming in the process Normal’s single-season points producer. It was a seesaw season featuring a handful of furious comebacks which, more often than not, came up short, such as a 47-42 overtime loss on Feb. 10 at the hands of non-conference opponent Peoria Manual. The team’s resilience and toughness was perhaps best exemplified in the play of 5-5 freshman forward Jimmy Melton, who spent his childhood at Victory Hall, a boys’ home in Normal (today the building is home to an ISU fraternity). It’s believed several other 1941-42 Ironmen were from Victory Hall. Intercity schools—NCHS, Bloomington, U High and Trinity (now Central Catholic)—used to play everyone else twice each season. The Ironmen lost both times to much-larger and Big 12 member BHS, whose lineup included brothers “Bump” and Pete Elliott. Both boys ended up playing and coaching football in the Big Ten, with Bump serving as University of Michigan’s head coach from 1959 to 1968, and Pete becoming an all-American quarterback with the Wolverines and coaching at the U of I. Slippery speedster Anderson and his fellow Ironmen, though, swept fellow Corn Belt member U High, while splitting two games with evenly matched Trinity. On Feb. 13, they lost 35-31 at “The Pit,” the sorely missed bandbox of a gym at the Catholic school’s former Center Street location. The regular season ended for NCHS on Feb. 27 with a disappointing 48-47 loss to the Don Cooke and Harlan Otto-led Danvers Dragons. Redemption, though, was right around the corner as the Ironmen had all their furnaces firing in lopsided victories over Chenoa, El Paso and U-High to capture the regional crown. At the Peoria Sectional, the “mighty mites” of Normal got their revenge over Peoria Manual, and then out-battled Havana in thrilling fashion to meet East Peoria in the Mar. 13 sectional championship. It was an honest-to-goodness barnburner, as Anderson swished a 30-footer with 25 seconds left for a 37-36 victory, punching the Ironmen’s ticket to Champaign and a Mar. 19 state finals appearance at Huff Gym. NCHS had the second smallest enrollment (468 students) of the schools in the “sweet sixteen” that year (the state finals would be pared to the “elite eight” in 1956.) The 1942 field included Centralia, Chicago Lindblom, Freeport, Olney and Quincy, among others. Alas, the Ironmen’s magical postseason run ended with a decisive 45-34 loss to “towering” Big 12 champion Streator Township, which at the time had an enrollment of 1,100. Two forwards for the Bulldogs, Ben Kristal and Don Morris, were too big and athletic for overmatched NCHS. “Andy” Anderson managed only ten points, with six of those coming at the charity stripe. “The Streator boys handled him rather roughly at times,” The Pantagraph couldn’t help but coolly observe. For those keeping score at home, Centralia, led by Dike Eddleman, beat Paris 35-33 to claim the school’s third state championship. Most of Ironmen served in World War II. Team captain Jim Pemberton, for example, fought with the 103rd Infantry Division in Europe, receiving the Bronze Star for heroism under fire. Dale Steege, a 6-2 center, fought in the South Pacific with the Marines, while Jim Melton, the Victory Hall kid, served in the Navy (unfortunately, space prohibits a full accounting of the 1941-42 roster.) Once back in Central Illinois, Pemberton sold furniture and then insurance, and found time to serve on the McLean County Board and become a charter member of the Heartland Community College Board. He passed away in 2002. Steege was a plumber and strong union man living on East Locust Street in Bloomington at the time of his death in 1990. Melton put in 22 years at Firestone Tire and Rubber Co., dying in 2008. What better way to end a wonderful story like this but with another wonderful story. “Hap coached all the major sports, but he focused on football and track,” Ed Alsene recalled of Normal’s head coach Hap Arends. “When he saw Anderson and this group coming in, he went out and bought a basketball coaching book and got more serious about it.”",

    "content": "In late October 1921, the Bloomington Buffaloes, a “colored” basketball team, defeated a rival club called the Independents by the score of 48 to 36. “This makes the eighth straight win for the Buffaloes over some of Bloomington’s crack white teams,” reported The Pantagraph. “The Buffaloes want a heavy schedule and are willing to book games with all comers.” During the first half of the 1920s, the Buffaloes were one of the stronger independent basketball teams in Central Illinois. The club, which also competed in loosely organized leagues, traveled throughout Central Illinois to play white and black teams wherever they could—from the smaller towns to the bigger cities. The Buffaloes tipped off against rivals from Bellflower, Cropsey, Delavan, Heyworth, Hudson, Lexington, Morton, Peoria, Stanford, Strawn, Wapella, Waynesville and many other villages, town and cities. Home games were usually played at a public school gymnasium in Bloomington—either at the high school or one of the elementary / secondary schools, such as Irving. It’s possible, but unlikely, the “Buffs” competed against racially integrated teams. Edward Bynum, the Buffaloes’ manager, was a veteran of World War I. Several players were veterans as well, including Paul E. Turlington. These black “cagers” (as basketball players were once known) had served in the Eighth Regiment, Illinois National Guard, which during the war was reorganized as the 370th Infantry, becoming in the process the highly decorated “Black Devils” regiment. At one time or another, the Buffaloes lineup included Eugene Bynum, Edward’s brother, “Speed” Walker, a Bloomington High School standout athlete, Virgil Dean, Walter Gaines, Rozell Samuels, Harry Woods and others. Several Buffaloes also made a name for themselves on the diamond with the Bloomington Colored Giants, an African-American baseball team active around the same time. There were other all-black Twin City basketball teams of the era, including the Bloomington Vandals, though they enjoyed nothing like the organizational stability and hardwood success of the Buffalos. Although it’s not known exactly why the local team carried the nickname “Buffaloes,” in all likelihood it honored the African-American 10th Cavalry Regiment of Wild West fame. Cavalrymen in this decorated regiment were known as Buffalo Soldiers. The Bloomington Buffaloes operated as a social-athletic club, with several leaders of the local African-American community serving as officers. The team’s treasurer (at least during the 1922-23 season) was Dr. Eugene Covington, a well-respected Bloomington physician. For most games spectators were charged admission, with proceeds likely covering various expenses, from the visiting team’s travel to renting the gymnasium. A deteriorating racial climate—on both the national and local levels—marked the decade of the 1920s. In the Twin Cities, African-Americans faced not only segregated beaches at Miller Park, a despicable practice dating to 1908, but increasing Jim Crow restrictions when it came to private and public accommodations. By the end of the decade, for example, blacks could not eat in downtown Bloomington restaurants or stay in downtown hotels. Although these written and unwritten rules of racial segregation treated local African Americans as second-class citizens, the Buffaloes—at least when they stepped onto the basketball court— were able to compete on an equal basis with all comers, black and white. During the 1921-1922 season, Coach Bynum added Richard Tate to the Buffaloes roster. Tate, a stellar halfback for the Bloomington High School football team, would go on play baseball (1927, 1935) and football (1926-27) for Illinois State Normal University. He was inducted into the Illinois State Athletics Hall of Fame in 1972. In the 1922-23 season, the team “imported” several out-of-towners, including Henry Hatchett of Joliet and Mack (or “Mace”) Willis from Danville, to strengthen the homegrown lineup. From all available evidence, it appears the Buffaloes faced little overtly hostile racial animus when visiting small rural communities to play all-white teams in front of all-white crowds. One of the few controversies occurred in December 1922 when the Buffaloes refused to travel to San Jose, Ill., to play the local Triple A.’s. After Bloomington beat visiting San Jose on Dec. 19, the Buffaloes cancelled the scheduled return game at the San Jose Methodist Episcopal Church gymnasium. “Word came to the Buffaloes,” reported The Pantagraph, “that the San Jose boys planned to have the Buffaloes beaten up and then chased out of town, regardless of the outcome of the game.” The San Jose team and its boosters cried foul. “No visiting team at San Jose has received anything but the most courteous treatment from the players and public,” declared C.E. Curtis on behalf of San Jose. Curtis noted that “colored” baseball teams from Bloomington and Peoria had played in San Jose without incident. On Feb. 15, 1923, the Buffaloes beat the Vandals, an African-American club from Peoria. With that win, according to The Pantagraph, “Bloomington’s colored boys” now stood atop the standings of an African-American basketball league. Little is known of this league, though it likely operated on an informal basis and, in addition to Bloomington and Peoria, may have included teams from Decatur, Lincoln, Springfield and elsewhere. Lopsided losses were not uncommon, and depending on the particular lineup on a given day, the Buffaloes could be on the winning or losing end of such contests. To cite one representative example, on Dec. 26, 1924, the Buffaloes trounced Hudson’s “Independent Five” 42-6. Near the end of the 1923-24 season, Feb. 29, 1924, the Buffaloes met L.R. Baugh’s Decorators for what was called the “independent championship” of Bloomington. The Buffaloes came into the contest with a stellar 31-3 record, while the Decorators, sponsored by Lucien R. Baugh’s interior decorating business, stood at an equally impressive 19-1. The defensive-minded game—said to be “fast and furious from start to finish”—ended with the Decorators besting the Buffaloes 17-10. After completion of this successful season, the Buffaloes were mostly inactive until the club reappeared on the local sports scene in late 1930. At this time their schedule included games as far away as Evanston, and their best player was Harry Caldwell, who lettered in basketball at ISNU.",

    "content": "The collections of the McLean County Museum of History include some 20,000 objects, and everyone one of them has a story to tell. An early 19th century wooden moldboard plow used by Blooming Grove pioneer Thomas Orendorff, for instance, offers a tangible link to the early settlement period now nearly two centuries past. And a late 20th century Ganesh statue once belonging to Bloomington resident Balwant Singh speaks to the immigrant experience and the emergence of the area’s large and dynamic Indian community. This being springtime, though, let us turn away from the more serious subjects of work and faith to matters of play, specifically men at play and the game of baseball. One the many wonderful artifacts in the history museum relating to the national pastime is a well-worn catcher’s mitt around 100 years old. It was once the glove of Walter J. “Butch” Henline, a Major League catcher of the 1920s who got his start with the Bloomington Bloomers of the old Illinois-Indiana-Iowa (I-I-I) League. Also known as the Three-I, Three Eye or even “Triple Orb,” the I-I-I was a respected low minor league with a reputation for developing promising prospects for the “high” minors, such as the Pacific Coast League and the American Association. And many of these young players would eventually punch their ticket to “the Show” (the Major Leagues). Bloomington was a member of the Three Eye for nearly four decades, from its inaugural season of 1901 to 1939. The Bloomers (for that was the club’s nickname most years) played at Fans Field on the city’s far south side. The long-gone ball field is now the site of Bloomington Parks and Recreation’s R.T. Dunn Fields, which are behind the National Guard armory. The story of how one of Butch Henline’s gloves made it to the McLean County Museum of History begins in the spring of 1919 and the start of the Three-I League season. After a year-and-a-half hiatus due to World War I, the Three Eye reformed in 1919, though with two fewer clubs than the preferred eight-team arrangement. The Bloomers were joined that season by the Evansville Black Sox, Moline Plowboys, Peoria Tractors, Rockford Rox and the Terre Haute Browns, making for an Illinois-Indiana-Iowa League with no representative from the Hawkeye State (the Cedar Rapids Rabbits would join the league for the 1920 campaign). With less than two weeks before the start of the 1919 season, Bloomers skipper Joe Dunn picked up Butch Henline from the Indianapolis Indians of the American Association, with the expectation that the talented-but-green prospect would end the season back in Indy. Henline earned $150 a month with the Bloomers, or the equivalent of $2,200 in today’s dollars, adjusted for inflation. Bloomington’s season began May 5 with a 1-0 victory over the visiting Tractors of Peoria. These two clubs traded first place several times during the first two months of the season before the Bloomers pulled away around Independence Day. The season ended Sept. 1 with the pennant winners 39 games above .500 at 80-41, and second-place Peoria some 12 games back at 68-54. As expected, Henline was sent to Indianapolis in early September to join the Indians for the final weeks of American Association play. The 24-year-old catcher then returned to Bloomington for the winter, and this city became his off-season home for several years. At some point during his time in Bloomington he became involved with Lincoln School teacher Marguerite (Margaret) Miller. At Lincoln, a grade school on Bloomington’s south side, Miller helped run district-wide music programs, among her many other teaching duties. In 1920, Joe Dunn and his Bloomers repeated as Three-I League champs. Despite a “flattering offer” from local ownership to stay in Bloomington, Henline returned to Indianapolis where he could prove himself over the long season against top-tier talent. And sure enough, two years later he was the everyday catcher with the big league Philadelphia Phillies. From 1922 to 1924, Henline appeared in at least 110 games a season for the Phillies, batting a healthy .308 during that time. Although not known as a long-ball hitter in the majors, he made a splash in his first full season when he hit three homers in a single game, Sept. 15, 1922, against the St. Louis Cardinals. Even after Henline established himself as a well-paid big league backstop, he still “wintered” in Bloomington, likely pulled to icy, windswept Central Illinois by a certain school teacher. During the off-season he kept in shape by, among other things, bowling. In early 1923 The Pantagraph noted that he had the area’s highest single-game score of the season “when he cut the wood down for the count of 278.” Butch Henline and Margaret Miller married on Oct. 25, 1923, in the groom’s hometown of Fort Wayne, Ind. The couple returned to Bloomington and lived for several years in an attractive wood-frame house on the 1000 block of South Main Street. In 1927, Henline was part of three-team trade that sent him to Brooklyn, and for three seasons he was the reserve catcher for the Robins (as the Dodgers were then known). His Major League career sputtered to an end in Chicago where he appeared in 14 games over two seasons, 1930-1931, for the White Sox. The Henlines, who had moved to Sarasota, Fla., operated a hotel that attracted a fair number of Bloomington vacationers and snowbirds. Butch Henline, unable to give up the game he loved, eventually took to umpiring, working his way up through the minors to become a National League official for four seasons, 1945 to 1948. He was even part of the umpiring crew for the 1947 All-Star Game. Walter “Butch” Henline passed away on Oct. 9, 1957 at the age of 62, and Margaret Miller Henline followed in 1979. Okay, you might be asking yourself, what about Henline’s catcher’s mitt now in the collections of the McLean County Museum of History? Well, sometime around 1926, Margaret Miller, who by that time was married to Henline, gave Bloomington High School student Ed LaBounty one of her husband’s catcher’s mitts. LaBounty had attended Lincoln School, and several years later he still kept in touch with his former eighth grade teacher. When she learned that LaBounty was the high school catcher she gave him the glove. Ed LaBounty kept the old mitt into adulthood and marriage. Ownership eventually fell to Ed’s son Bill LaBounty, who remembers using it on occasion when playing American Legion ball in the 1940s, though by that time the “old-style” mitt had become more of a curiosity piece than a game day glove. The catcher’s mitt remained in the LaBounty family until 2004. That’s when Bill, having decided it needed a safe, permanent home, donated it to the McLean County Museum of History. Today Henline’s glove is stored in a secure, climate-controlled storage room to ensure it will be around long into the future, ready to tell its story to generations yet to come.",

    "content": "Business colleges played an important but often-overlooked role in American education. For the better part of a half-century, Brown’s Business College in downtown Bloomington offered “solid and practical” training for young men and women entering the lower rungs of the white-collar workforce. The Industrial Age demanded bookkeepers, stenographers, cashiers and correspondent clerks, the training of which traditional four-year colleges and universities generally ignored. Railway, telegraph, manufacturing and express companies needed office workers to keep their increasingly bureaucratic, paperwork-heavy operations running smoothly and efficiently. In addition, the invention of the typewriter—and later other office machines, such as the stenograph (a shorthand machine)—led to the further specialization of office jobs. Business colleges throughout the nation filled the education vacuum. “In this age of sharp competition there is little chance for the young person who faces the world without the knowledge and skill that comes from special training,” read a Brown’s Business College student handbook from 1900. Founded by G.W. Brown of Jacksonville, Ill., the school established “campuses” in mid- and small-size Illinois cities such as Centralia, Champaign, Decatur, Galesburg, Jacksonville, Moline, Ottawa, Peoria, Rock Island and Rockford, as well as Terre Haute, IN and Davenport, IA. Business colleges such as Brown’s enabled young women (who often far outnumbered men in graduating classes) to participate in the hustle and bustle of commercial life, though they were generally restricted to secretarial-like positions. Women were also on the teaching faculty. In 1903, for instance, Margaret King headed the shorthand department in Bloomington. Brown’s also made appeals to farmers, housekeepers, ministers and others. “Be a business farmer,” read a November 1919 Brown’s advertisement. “A business education is the trotting mate of up-to-date farming.” The college offered classes in Bloomington from the 1890s until the early 1940s, attracting students from the Twin Cities and places such as Heyworth, Atlanta, Paxton, and El Paso. For a while, classes were held on the third floor of the Henry Keiser Building, 505-507 N. East St. (which today is part of the East Street Hardware & Tools building). Around 1909, the school moved into the third floor of the Hoblit Building, located at the southwest corner of Main and Mulberry streets (see accompanying photograph). Back in 1900, Brown’s offered a comprehensive commercial course, in addition to one concentrating on bookkeeping and another on shorthand and typewriting. The regular school year ran ten months—early September to early July—with one week off for Christmas. Daily class sessions ran 9:00 a.m. to 12 noon, and then 1:30 to 4:00 p.m. Tuition was $20 for each ten-week term (or the equivalent of $580 today, adjusted for inflation). To accommodate those already in the workforce, Brown’s offered night classes, which in 1900 were held 7:00 to 9:00 p.m. three days a week. There were also summer sessions and a correspondence program whereby one could study via postal mail. The curriculum was surprisingly rigorous. The full course included bookkeeping (theory and practice), commercial arithmetic, writing, commercial law (including contracts and personal property), business correspondence, spelling, shorthand, typewriting, indexing and filing. There were also detours into business history, political economy, government and other subjects. Brown’s promised a real-world course of study, rather than one “superficial and embellished with frills of fancy penmanship of no practical value.” Completion of a full course of study could take 10 months or longer, though shorter courses could be wrapped up in less time. Brown’s graduates, armed with a diploma from an accredited and well-respected business college, usually had little trouble finding employment. “Businessmen appreciate good help, and while thoroughly qualified stenographers are in greater demand than ever before, the half-trained, or ‘shorthand cripples’ stand little chance of promotion … there is surely no greater bore than an incompetent stenographer at one’s elbow,” declared Brown’s. The commencement program of February 26, 1919 in Bloomington included a dinner at the Illinois Hotel and a ceremony at the Chatterton Opera House. Harlan E. Read, who with a partner bought out Brown in 1911, delivered the address to graduates. “If, through the work you have done here,” he said, “you have been brought to see the dignity of labor—the importance of accuracy and speed—the splendid commercial opportunities open to all who will pay the price in effort, then ... your schooling has been profitable to you and will bring credit to the institution from which you have graduated.” During the Great Depression, university-educated men and women turned to Brown’s and other business colleges to improve their office skills and hence job opportunities. Brown’s would stage contests and cash rewards for fast and reliable typing, stenography and shorthand. In 1931, Principal Elmer Hubble offered $10 to the first student reaching 90 words per minute with no more than five errors in a ten-minute span. That same year, Bernice Bartels received the Gregg Transcription Award for keeping a pace of 120 words per minute with an allowance of 30 errors (though Bartels had only 9 errors). By the early 1930s, recent graduates included Hazel Brucker, who became the head of the records department at Brokaw Hospital, where she found herself taking dictation from surgeons as they operated on patients. Graduates working in Bloomington included Floyd Meiner in the cost accounting department at Meadows Manufacturing Co.; Earl Thomas, bookkeeper and stenographer for Schwulst Lumber & Coal Co.; Martha Ward, secretary for the Illinois Wesleyan University School of Music; Alice Ward, stenotypist secretary for Benson Real Estate Co.; Lester Gerig, stenographer for Capen Investment Co., and many, many others. The end of World War II and the GI Bill led to an enrollment boom in four-year colleges and universities, while the 1960s brought explosive growth in two-year community colleges. These and other factors led to the decline of business colleges in the mold of Brown’s. On June 4, 1929, local attorney W.K. Bracken delivered the annual Brown’s commencement address. The average age of the 37 graduates was 20, with their courses ranging from bookkeeping and accounting to shorthand and typewriting. “I have become convinced that you not only have learned how to operate certain mechanical devices,” Bracken said, “but that you also have learned how to use and operate your head and heart in such a way as will make you real women and men.”",

    "content": "Try as he might, Bloomington Mayor Robert McGraw could not close the Subway Club, an afterhours “set-up” joint on the city’s west side that he once described as a gathering place for “perverts, bar girls, bootleggers and gamblers.” Located on 900 block of West Chestnut Street, the Subway Club was one of several such establishments in the city. Set-up clubs typically opened at 1 a.m., just as the city taverns were legally required to close. Patrons paid a cover charge—thus becoming “members” of the “club”—and as such were allowed to bring their own booze. These clubs, which then remained open into the early morning hours, provided nonalcoholic mixers and other “set ups” for the hard stuff purchased earlier and elsewhere by members. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Subway Club had the well-deserved reputation as the rowdiest, most lawless place in all the Twin Cities. The Club derived its name from the pedestrian “subway” built in 1916 that ran under the south end of the once-sprawling, bustling Chicago & Alton Railroad yards and shops complex. The underpass, connecting the 900 and 1100 blocks of West Chestnut Street at opposite ends of the rail yards, enabled west side residents to avoid the danger of crossing multiple lines of congested train traffic. The Subway Club occupied one-half of the first floor of a substantial three-story 19th century brick building not more than 65 feet from the tracks. For years it was the Chicago & Alton Hotel, and then served as home for the Alton Community Club and later the GM&O Cafe, among other businesses. Louis DiBattista, the Subway Club’s proprietor, was said to have been a “country club steward, tavern operator and bartender” prior to opening his set-up place on West Chestnut in the fall of 1956. From the beginning, DiBattista’s club was known as a “haven for intemperates of every description.” Sometime in the late spring of 1957, the Bloomington police put the club under surveillance. Then, at 4:30 a.m. on Saturday, June 8, a five-man Bloomington police detail led by Chief Fred Giermann raided the club. Armed with a search warrant, the cops seized “a quantity of cheap whiskey.” The 43-year-old DiBattista was charged with illegally selling liquor under both state and city statues, as well as violating state law by operating a gaming house. On July 11, 1957, Police Court Magistrate Walter Reiner fined the club owner $200 or $300 (accounts vary) plus $40.80 in costs on the state charge of illegal liquor sale (the two other charges—running afoul of both the city liquor ordinance and the state gaming law—were ultimately dismissed). Two months later, Magistrate Reiner found DiBattista guilty of assault and battery, fining him another $57 and court costs. That altercation, which left a 21-year-old woman on the floor of the club unconscious, occurred June 30. The following spring, on May 11, 1958, Bloomington police, backed by county sheriff’s officers, staged a second raid on the Subway Club. Evidence collected this time around included “a quantity of whiskey and beer, two dice cups, a numbered ‘roulette type’ wheel and a smaller automatic electronically operated numbered wheel.” Arrested once more, DiBattista faced new state and local charges for selling alcohol without a license and possessing gambling devices. In early Sept. 1958, The Pantagraph reported that the defendant had “chalked up more court time than many lawyers in the past year and half because of his alleged and proved illegal operations at the club.” One month later, at 2 a.m. on Oct. 1, five sheriff’s deputies arrested the embattled owner at his club for aggravated assault and inflicting “severe personal injury” on a Gibson City man, who had to be hospitalized. Late that same month, a McLean County Court jury, after hearing four days of contentious, conflicting testimony, held DiBattista guilty on three counts of illegal liquor sales stemming from the May 1958 raid. “The trial set a recent record for longevity,” remarked The Pantagraph. “Probably more than 1,000 pages of testimony were recorded.” DiBattista, sentenced to four months in state custody, served his time at the state penal farm in Vandalia. Upon his release, he headed straight back to Bloomington. In May 1959, DiBattista and Robert Bacon, a 36 or 37-year-old who split his time between Bloomington and Peoria, partnered to remake the Subway Club as a “mixed-race” afterhours establishment. In other words, they hoped to open the club’s doors to African Americans at a time when most—if not all—bars in the Twin Cities were strictly segregated. Plans to make the west side set-up club “interracial” infuriated Mayor McGraw. “I’m not going to stand for it. I’ll get police, the building inspector, the fire inspector—anybody to close that place,” he said. “It’s not a matter of discrimination. I’m doing this to protect the Negroes as much as the whites.” Such was the state of race relations that McGraw’s tirade drew no public complaints or outcry. At any rate, the plan to welcome black patrons was quickly dropped, and that summer, Bacon was shot twice and severely wounded in a “tavern fracas” in Peoria. By the fall of 1960, Mayor McGraw was at wit’s end with the Subway Club thumbing its nose at the law. “One more complaint,” he said on Oct. 26, “and I swear I’ll close that place once and for all … I’m just damn fed up.” One week later, McGraw ordered the police department to station a uniformed officer at the club during its open hours. That policy took effect on Nov. 4, 1960, and two weeks later, DiBattista capitulated, agreeing to cancel the club’s lease and use its space to expand his Hickory House restaurant, which occupied the other half of the building’s first floor. “I hope that’s the end of it,” declared McGraw. But of course, it was anything but! On Nov. 22, 1961, the police raided the still-open Subway Club, arresting 14 individuals, five of whom were women, for watching an adult or “stag” film. “The club,” acknowledged The Pantagraph, “has operated almost continually since the closing announcement.” Despite claims of innocence, DiBattista was charged with exhibiting “immoral pictures.” The end of the Subway Club finally came on the morning of Jan. 23, 1963, when the three-story building that housed the notorious set-up joint was lost in a ferocious blaze. With temperatures reaching 16-below zero, firefighters battled the cold as much as the smoke and flames. The Subway Club has been gone for 56 years, but its legend lives on. On Feb. 26, 1958, a 32-year-old Bloomington man and a 28-year-old Danvers resident brawled outside the club. Both were charged with drunk and disorderly conduct and, being unable to pay the $54 fine, spent the night in jail. “It was never established in court,” noted The Pantagraph, “whether they had been fighting each other or someone else.”",

    "content": "“A shopping trip takes on all of the glamour and excitement of the space age when you visit the beautiful new Eastland Shopping Center.” Such was the sales pitch for the Feb. 16, 1967 ribbon cutting ceremony marking the formal debut of Bloomington’s indoor mall. The opening of Eastland more than a half century ago ranks as one of the more momentous events in Twin City history. The mall hastened the flight of retailers large and small from downtown Bloomington, and by doing so cemented the city’s eastward pivot toward the U.S. Route 66 beltline (now Veterans Parkway.) The mall’s success, though, also meant Bloomington remained a regional center for out-of-town shoppers, as well as a dependable job creator and sales tax generator. Although less than 2½ miles separated the downtown district from the new indoor mall, they represented vastly different worlds, separated as they were in time by the emergence and then dominance of the automobile in American society. Located at the junction of the Route 66 and Illinois Route 9, the $4.5 million 30-acre project was developed by Copaken Realty of Kansas City, Mo., and designed by Sidney H. Morris & Associates of Chicago. Other enclosed shopping centers credited to this architectural firm include Lakehurst Mall in Waukegan, Ill. (opened in 1971); Northwoods Mall in Peoria (1973); and Hickory Point Mall in Forsyth, Ill., on the north edge of Decatur (1978.) Eastland was not the first retail center to stake its future on the fast-sprawling, automobile-friendly east side. The first phase of the Towanda Plaza development dates to the late 1950s, and Kmart opened across Route 9 from the mall’s future site on September 20, 1962. Yet those projects—and the many others to follow—never matched the size and ambition of Eastland Shopping Center (as the mall was first known.) Irwin Blitt of Copaken Realty appeared before Bloomington Rotarians in mid-October 1964 to trumpet the social and economic revolution wrought by the indoor mall, which was fast becoming a dominant symbol of the affluence and consumerism of postwar America. Blitt noted that during the past eight years, the number of shopping centers in the U.S. had increased from 2,200 to nearly 10,000. “Centers are opening up at a rate of three a day,” he told the gathered Rotarians. “This year, centers will do $50 billion in sales in 700 million square feet of floor space.” Ground was broken for the Eastland project on Dec. 29, 1964. Rowe Construction Co. of Bloomington handled the grading work for the general contractor, Inland Construction Co. of Morton Grove, Ill. In many ways, the shopping center was defined not by its stores but by its acre upon acre of free parking—enough to accommodate 2,200 automobiles. Even more exciting to shoppers back then was the fact that there wasn’t a parking meter in sight! For an increasingly car-centric community and region, this advantage alone guaranteed Eastland’s success at the expense of downtown Bloomington. Sears became the shopping center’s first tenant when it opened a 100,000 square foot store Feb. 17, 1966. The retailing juggernaut offered 51 merchandise departments, from infant wear to building materials. Customer services included “catalog ordering, decorator shop, gift wrapping, custom-made draperies [and] slip covers, and installation of fencing, floor covering, plumbing-heating, air conditioning and awnings and blinds.” In addition, the automotive service center featured an eight-bay garage. J.C. Penney’s followed Sears to Eastland nine months later, opening on Nov. 10, 1966. The new Penney’s was four times as large as the one downtown, which had been located in the old Braley-Field Building at the northwest corner of the courthouse square (Maguire’s Bar and Grill now occupies the lower floor of this building.) Sears and Penney’s were then joined by an A&P grocery store, the mall’s first non-anchor tenant. By Jan. 1967, Eastland officials had lined up some 20 tenants, a half-dozen or more of which were local retailers with a downtown Bloomington presence, including Bachrach’s, a men’s clothing store; Chadband’s Jewelry; Murray’s Boot Shop; Musicland; Pines Smartwear; and W.H. Roland’s. Also coming to Eastland were national or regional chains, such as Kinney Shoes, 31 Flavors Ice Cream, the Singer Co., Topsy’s Sidewalk Cafe, Walgreens (with the Grill Room restaurant) and Woolworth’s. It’s hard for us today to appreciate just how revolutionary indoor shopping centers were to postwar consumers. Eastland management promised local residents “a new dimension in shopping convenience.” The “Center Mall” connecting the department store anchors offered shoppers an enclosed, “climatized” environment. “Through the park-like enclosed mall,” declared Eastland management, “you can go from store to store without going outdoors, until all of your shopping is completed.” Two fountains and indoor landscaping were added to give the mall a public square or Main Street feel. Another radical change for shoppers was that many of the retailers lining the mall were “open-fronted.” That is, they offered little in the way of walls or other barriers between the store’s interior and the mall, making it even easier to stroll about the all-weather “shopper’s paradise.” Eastland Shopping Center’s official opening was held Thursday, Feb. 16. Some 300 to 350 eager shoppers and curious onlookers gathered at the mall’s “pagoda” for a ribbon-cutting ceremony (see accompanying photograph.) Al Pizzamiglio’s orchestra was there to provide music as folks explored the Center Mall and the eighteen newly opened stores. “The parking is free and easy and it’s always a comfortable 72 degrees in Eastland Shopping Center,” was the promise. Eastland Mall (as the renamed shopping center became known) was a sustained success, at least before the so-called “retail apocalypse” of the past decade or so in which brick-and-mortar stores have faced ever-dwindling sales and cultural irrelevance. Long before the existential threat posed by online shopping, Eastland underwent several expansions. In the early 1970s, Bergner’s, the Twin City’s first new department store in decades, necessitated a major addition. The 1980s brought another department store, Kohl’s, as well as the food court. In the fall of 2002, Eastland Mall boasted occupancy rate of 98 percent and five anchors—Sears, Penney’s, Bergner’s, Famous-Barr and Kohl’s. Yet the brute efficiencies of Amazon and other online behemoths—their ability to offer low prices, selection and, most importantly, next-day delivery—have laid waste to malls across the nation, Eastland included. The Eastland of 2019 is a shadow of its former self, with Kohl’s the lone surviving anchor. Yet unlike other malls that have been shuttered and bulldozed, Eastland has managed to attract a few new and nontraditional tenants. The former JCPenney store, for instance, is now occupied by H&M, a Swedish “fast fashion” retailer, and Planet Fitness, an exercise club.",

    "content": "There’s plenty of handwringing these days over the corrosive effects of political polarization. And yes, things are pretty bad today. That said, perhaps we should take solace in the fact that things aren’t as bad right now as they were in 1866, one year after the Civil War. To say President Andrew Johnson’s September 7, 1866, stop in Bloomington was a disaster, politically speaking, is putting it mildly. After all, it’s not every day a sitting U.S. president gets chased out of town by an unruly mob. A Democrat from Tennessee, Johnson was the only southern U.S. senator to remain in the Union during the Civil War. For the 1864 presidential election, Republicans, in a conciliatory gesture to both northern and border state Democrats, picked Johnson as Abraham Lincoln’s running mate. The following spring, Lincoln’s assassination on Good Friday vaulted Johnson into the White House, and it was only a matter of time before the stubborn, ill-tempered Tennessean clashed with Radical Republicans in Congress. At issue was the post-Civil War “reconstruction” of the secessionist South. Many so-called “radical” Republicans favored punishing Confederate leaders and extending civil and political rights to some 4 million formerly enslaved African Americans. Johnson, on the other hand, supported the rapid reincorporation of the former Confederate states into the Union, with little or no regard to the rights of freedpeople. “This is a country for white men, and by God, as long as I am president, it shall be a government for white men,” Johnson told the governor of Missouri. On August 27, 1866, President Johnson embarked on an unprecedented 18-day speaking tour in an attempt to rally northern Democrats to his cause of limited Reconstruction. The tour, which became known as the “Swing Around the Circle,” took the president and his party on a circuitous route from Washington, D.C. to New York, Chicago, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Pittsburgh—and many cities and towns in between—before heading back to the nation’s capital. The large party accompanying Johnson included Secretary of State William H. Seward, Navy Secretary Gideon Welles and Postmaster General Alexander W. Randall, as well as potential rival Ulysses S. Grant. The “Swing” began well enough, but by the September 3 stop in Cleveland, rancorous crowds began jeering the president, saving their enthusiasm for Gen. Grant, the war hero many Republicans embraced as the true heir to the martyred Lincoln. After Chicago, the increasingly embattled Johnson and his party traveled south to St. Louis on the Chicago & Alton Railroad, with brief stops in Bloomington and elsewhere along the line. For its part, The Pantagraph, a devoted supporter of Lincoln and now Grant, made no effort to hide its disdain for the current president, referring to Johnson as “His Accidency” or “The Presidential Demagogue.” Anticipating the president’s passage through Bloomington, the newspaper caustically noted that the pro-Johnson crowd would consist of area residents representing “every deserter from the rebel army, every paroled rebel, every draft skulker, every draft resister, every man who opposed the war—in short, the whole [Democratic] party on hand to carry out the program of the leaders.” On September 7, a Bloomington crowd of some 4,000 mostly Republican supporters gathered to watch the President Johnson’s train pull into the west side C&A depot. Grant appeared at the rear platform to shake hands with supporters, generating, according to The Pantagraph, “the wildest excitement we have ever witnessed.” After Grant stepped back inside the train, outnumbered Democrats countered with calls for the president. Johnson then stepped out and attempted a speech but found it impossible to continue in the face of “deafening cries” for Grant. “If you would only be quiet you might employ this valuable time in hearing a speech,” Postmaster General Randall scolded the unruly crowd before backing down himself amid a chorus of “hisses and groans.” Someone then called for three cheers for Grant, and the ensuing celebration was such that a number in the crowd were injured. Johnson reappeared, managed a few lines between “huzzahs” for Grant, and as he waited for the crowd to quiet down the train unceremoniously pulled out of the depot. As a final indignity, the president’s train passed an effigy strung from a telegraph pole, the figure holding “a loaf of bread in one hand, and a lump of butter in the other” (political appointees and supporters of Johnson’s were said to comprise the “Bread and Butter Brigade.”) The Pantagraph applauded the “spontaneous outburst of Illinois indignation” aimed at Johnson and his policies “The Copperheads,” declared the newspaper, employing the derisive term for Northern traitors during the Civil War, “know that our people have become thoroughly disgusted with the president’s insolent insults, and that the time has come for him to be met by a stern rebuke.” Democrats made much hay over the claim that Republicans—by shouting down the president—could not countenance free speech. The Pantagraph would have none of this line of reasoning. Johnson, it argued, “has made the same speech almost every time he has spoken since he left Washington, and that has been read and reread until it has been almost committed to memory.” In fact, the robust give-and-take between the speakers and crowd represented anything but the repression of First Amendment rights. “If there wasn’t a little the freest speech exhibited at the depot ever heard in this town, we will give up the point,” it was said. “Every man had his say, whether he was Democrat or Unionist.” Point in fact, such a free-spirited display regarding the most contentious issue of the day would have been unthinkable in the unreconstructed South. “When the crowd refused to hear the President the other day at the depot, it was done in a playful manner, and no one’s person was in the least danger,” reflected The Pantagraph. “Freedom of speech, however, does not exist in the South, and no one will be found hardy enough to gainsay this statement.” The newspaper went on to note the impossibility of African-American leader Frederick Douglass—to cite one example—conducting a speaking tour in the former Confederacy to promote African-American equality. In the end, the “Swing around the Circle” was an abject failure, as the 1866 midterm congressional elections ended in a landslide for Republicans, the party increasing its already formidable majority in Congress. Even so, President Andrew Johnson and the Radical Republicans remained at odds, with the intractable stalemate coming to a head in 1868 when the U.S. House of Representatives impeached him, though the Senate voted for acquittal by the narrowest of margins—a single vote.",

    "content": "Before the introduction of draft horses and then steam and gasoline-powered tractors, oxen provided the muscle on pioneer Corn Belt farms. These beasts of burden, which were usually yoked in pairs, were prized for their strength, steadiness and endurance. It was oxen power that helped early farmers refashion Central Illinois by plowing up the tallgrass prairie for cornfields and pastures, transforming a pristine, natural landscape to one devoted almost exclusively to commercial purposes. In 1831, William B. Carlock’s family settled northwest of Bloomington near the Woodford County / McLean County line. Between their farm and the new county seat of Bloomington there was a twelve-mile stretch of unbroken prairie, with nary a “fence or house or building of any kind to be seen.” Late in life, Carlock recounted how he had helped break the first prairie along this route. “The plow was drawn by four yoke of oxen,” he said, “and a boy about ten years of age and myself, then about nine, drove the oxen, he walking on one side of the team and myself on the other and each having a very long plaited buckskin whip.” Oxen, contrary to a popular misconception, are not a breed apart from cattle. Rather, they are castrated male cattle, usually four years or older, trained for heavy work. Although slower and more methodical than horses, oxen can pull heavier loads for longer durations. Known for their docility, oxen are also none-too-easily spooked and less excitable than horses—a trait which proved particularly beneficial when breaking a stretch of tallgrass prairie rife with rattlesnakes! “In the early day a great deal of the teaming, breaking prairie and ditching was done by oxen, and I had several teams,” recalled Samuel Baldridge, who settled in McLean County’s White Oak Township in 1852. His prized pair of oxen, Buck and Berry, helped train other pairs. In fact, they were so well schooled that when Baldridge called “ho! Buck” and “come under Berry” in their rail corral, the two would mosey on over and stick out their heads, ready for the yoke and a hard day’s work. Oxen were needed for more than prairie breaking. The first railroads did not reach Bloomington until 1853, and until then oxen carried heavy loads over land, including the important route from the Pekin wharf on the Illinois River to landlocked Bloomington. Oxen also plied town and city streets pulling heavy wagons loaded with everything from kegs of beer to grand pianos. Even after railroads arrived and brought wholesale changes to most everything everywhere, oxen were still needed to plow up the prairie, and in McLean County and elsewhere in Central Illinois there was much left to be broken. “We saw fourteen yoke of oxen yesterday on Washington Street, attached to one wagon,” reported the May 19, 1857 Pantagraph. “Probably they were going out to break prairie.” The fact that there is no taboo regarding the consumption of beef as there is with horsemeat proved to be another advantage in favor of the ox. In other words, many unfortunate oxen, after toiling under the yoke for several years, were then fattened for the farmer’s table or the slaughterhouse. In early July 1860, N.C. Bump of McLean County shipped 118 head of “fat cattle” to the New York market. Included were two six-year-old oxen, previously used for plowing or drayage, each weighing 4,300 pounds. Once freed of hard labor and “beefed up” (pun intended) by Bump they were able to gain 1,200 pounds in ten short months. In 1863, a pair of oxen owned by John Cheney of Cheney’s Grove took first place in the McLean County Fair. Cheney then spent the fall putting flesh on their too-lean frames and by Christmas Eve these blue ribbon beasts had become part of Bloomington butcher Edwin Hartry’s festive epicurean display. “This beef, and other meats, pork, mutton, etc., dressed in the finest style, was exhibited until midnight, forming the best show of meat ever seen in this city, if not in the state,” remarked The Pantagraph. Beginning in the latter 1850s, the increasing popularity of French draft horses known as Normans (and today as Percherons) led to a steady reduction in the number of oxen in Central Illinois. The Town of Normal became a national center for the importation, breeding and sale of Normans, which were large and muscular enough to handle much of the work previously reserved for oxen. Although horses remained an integral part of Corn Belt farming well into the 20th century, by that time oxen had all but disappeared from the countryside. Their numbers in McLean County, for instance, plummeted from 684 in 1850 (the first U.S. Census to count these animals) to a mere 25 by 1880. Another contributing factor in the decline of the ox involved the development of new farm equipment and implements. Cultivators, as well as harvesting and mowing machines, demanded a quicker pace in the field, one suited for the far more nimble and speedy horse than the plodding ox. A few years ago a vestige of this lost era was itself lost when a White Oak Township barn, said to the oldest in McLean County, succumbed to the elements. Built by Christian Ropp in 1857, the barn included “free” (or open) stalls, built specifically for oxen. Unfortunately, it’s not known if any still-standing barns in the area have architectural features that similarly hark back to the age when the ox strode the prairie. Oxen, with their strength, even temper and steady gait, proved a useful metaphor for poets and politicians alike. At a June 30, 1858, Republican congressional district convention in Joliet, Congressman Owen Lovejoy used the ox to help explain his support for a proposed legislative compromise that rankled his fellow abolitionists. The congressman “defended his action in the case as the best that could be done under the circumstances,” noted a Pantagraph correspondent at the convention. Lovejoy added that “if he was stuck fast in a slough (a low-lying, wet prairie), he would ride an ox out rather than not get out, and would not consider that he had thereby affirmed the principle that oxen were better animals to ride than horses, or had bound himself always to ride oxen thereafter.”",

    "content": "Although racially segregated schools are associated with the “Jim Crow” Deep South and the Civil Rights Movement, northern communities such as Bloomington also maintained officially recognized separate schools for black and white children. In fact, Bloomington’s all-white school board and white city leaders only belatedly and hesitantly ended the city’s racially segregated public school system when pressured to do so in the early 1870s by brave African-American schoolchildren and their supporters. According to available evidence, the first public school in Bloomington for black children opened in 1860. The school was located somewhere on South Madison Street, and its first teacher was a “Mrs. Howard,” said to be a missionary back from Burma. The Rev. P.H. Ward of the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Bloomington played a leading role in the fundraising effort for the “Colored School,” as it was known. “He reports success, in subscriptions and donations among white folks, to the amount of near $100, which he hopes to greatly increase,” noted the Jan. 9, 1860 Pantagraph after the good reverend visited the newspaper’s offices “in supplication for aid.” Although the state provided no funds for the instruction of African-American children (the landmark 1855 Common School Act of Illinois provided for the education of whites only), Bloomington’s colored school receive a share—albeit a very small and grossly unequal one—of local property taxes. When it came to integrating its schools, Bloomington lagged behind Normal, which in 1867 rallied behind the admission of a black girl to the Normal University model school. Bloomington’s colored school operated as quasi-public institution, so in addition to receiving local tax dollars, the black community raised supplementary funds to keep the austere wood-frame schoolhouse open. In the summer of 1862, for instance, the school held a charity program at Phoenix Hall on the south side of the courthouse square. The Pantagraph managed to be both complimentary and condescending to the school’s black students, noting that “in the performance of their various exercises, consisting of music, dialogues and declamations, as well as in manners, we could see but little difference between them and a school of ‘white folks’ of the same grade.” After the Civil War, the Bloomington Board of Education dragged its heels and straddled the fence when it came to desegregating its schools. There was no such heel dragging or fence straddling, however, when it came to the city’s frustrated and abused black community. At the Sept. 26, 1870 meeting of the school board, a “committee of colored citizens” requested that the directors “discontinue” the Colored School and admit children to neighborhood and grade-appropriate schools “without distinction of color.” One week later, at a special school board meeting, directors approved a resolution supporting the right of academically adept black students to enroll in white city schools, including the high school. Furthermore, on a motion of board member J.A. Jackman, “it was voted to allow colored children living in extreme parts of the city and unable to attend the colored school on account of distance to enter the school of the ward in which they live providing there are vacant seats and that the [school principals] have discretionary power to admit such pupils.” Although the board fell far short of advocating full and immediate integration, its actions were still met with howls of disapproval. One detractor, identified only as “A Citizen” in the Oct. 19, 1870 Pantagraph, claimed that white children held a “natural repugnance” to racially integrated schools. Black children, “A Citizen” continued, “necessarily feel humiliated and mortified in the presence of white children who refuse to accept them on equal terms of social intercourse.” Three months after “A Citizen’s” open letter, during the second week of January 1871, The Pantagraph reported on the “considerable excitement” caused when an unknown number of black children attempted to enroll at the Sixth Ward School over a period of several days (which was serving as temporary quarters for Fifth Ward pupils while their new school was being built). “The [colored] children continued to press their claims from time to time with a degree of firmness unusual to the race, but so far have been unable to gain admission; but on the other hand have been somewhat violently thrust from the [school]house by a special policeman,” reported the Jan. 12, 1871 Pantagraph. “The probability is that the difficulty will lead to a legal investigation of the matter, with a view of ascertaining whether colored citizens yet ‘have rights that white men are bound to respect.’” Indeed, those supporting the “sit in” demonstration staged by the bold black schoolchildren entered suit against the Board of Education. In addition, indictments were filed against Samuel M. Etter, city schools superintendent, and David K. Plumley, indentified as the “special policeman” who forcibly removed the black students from the school. It appears both indictments were dropped, but the case ended up in the Court of Chancery. Judge Thomas F. Tipton ruled that the Board of Education had the “right to say that the colored children shall occupy a separate building, and the only remedy for the people is to defeat the Board at the polls, and not rely upon the courts.” Yet the protests and the legal challenges helped deliver a grievous blow to the status quo of segregated schools. According to longtime city school superintendant Sarah Raymond, when she became principal of the new Fifth Ward (or No. 5) School at its opening in early 1872, it became the first in the city “to admit colored children with white children.” Even so, the Colored School remained open another two years. At the Dec. 29, 1873 meeting of the school board, the directors backed the dissolution of the school and the distribution of its pupils “to their respective wards as soon as convenient room can be found.” In 1882, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that the state constitution and a subsequent state act prohibited the establishment and maintenance of separate black and white school districts. Yet officially segregated schools survived in Illinois well into the 20th century. Shocking though it may seem, as late as 1949, some 10,000 black children in southern Illinois attended all-black schools in officially segregated districts. Although Bloomington’s public schools were integrated by the 1874-1875 school year, District 87 did not hire its first African-American teachers until the 1960s.",

    "content": "It was known as “the week the sun touched the earth.” In late August and early September 1859, two geomagnetic solar superstorms walloped our planet, illuminating the nighttime sky of Central Illinois with jaw-dropping northern light shows. Solar storms originate from sunspots, darker, cooler areas of the sun’s surface created by the twisting of its magnetic field. Enormous solar flares—“coronal mass ejections” in scientific parlance—leap outward from these sunspots, generating in the process solar wind shockwaves (think of a bullet leaving a gun). And on occasion, the earth sustains a direct hit from these shockwaves. When that happens, the solar winds of supercharged plasma buffet the earth’s magnetic shield, interacting with atoms and molecules in the upper reaches of the atmosphere. All this bumping about produces the transcendent “auroral forms” (clouds, flashes, waves, streamers, shafts, etc.) and colors (white, red, violet, pink, green, etc.) we see as northern lights. Two massive solar storms appearing four days apart in the late summer of 1859 gave “the week the sun touched the earth” its name. The first one reached here Aug. 28, and the second one Sept. 1. “Papers from all over the country, as far south as St. Louis, Louisville and Philadelphia at least, speak of the auroral display ... as the most brilliant which had been seen for years in their respective localities,” noted The Pantagraph in its a lengthy account of the first superstorm. And the lightshow was no less spectacular in Central Illinois. Today, we inhabit a world of visual overstimulation and saturation, and so it’s hard for us to appreciate how these “spectral campfires” (in the words of The Pantagraph) affected, aesthetically and imaginatively speaking, mid-19th century observers. Although some folks with certain religious proclivities interpreted the aurora borealis (a fancier name for northern lights) as a sign of the End Times, many Americans knew these seemingly fantastical displays were natural in origin and were related, somehow and someway, to electricity and magnetism. Regardless, many of the finely tuned (and attuned) accounts from the 1859 lightshows are impressively sublime. “For some time the aurora threw out remarkably bright wings along both eastern and western horizon,” recounted one observer, “and at the same time the tips of the streamers, where they converged near the zenith glowed with a remarkably intense and fiery redness.” Humans have witnessed solar storm-generated aurora borealis since time immemorial, but the storms themselves made little impact on the pre-electrical world. The back-to-back cosmic maelstroms of 1859, though, did play havoc with the Internet of the day—telegraphy. During geomagnetic solar storms of sufficient strength, telegraph lines and equipment remained “live” even when disconnected from a power source. In any case, atmospheric interference and overheated equipment meant few messages could get through during the height of these storms. In the late morning of Sept. 1, amateur English astronomer Richard Carrington was busy sketching an enormous cluster of sunspots when he unwittingly witnessed the origin of the week’s second superstorm—a sustained flare emanating from one of the spots, its brightness “fully equal to that of direct sunlight.” This mother of all coronal mass ejections, known today as the Carrington Event, was said to carry the energy of 10 billion (that’s billion with a “b”) atomic bombs. The aurora borealis it produced could be witnessed as far south as the Caribbean. “The fantastic northern lights were abroad in their strength again on Thursday night,” announced The Pantagraph, heralding the Sept. 1-2 storm. “They did not, while we watched them, assume so brilliant and variegated an appearance as on Sunday night [the Aug. 28 storm], but the display was a remarkably fine one notwithstanding.” “Remarkably fine,” it should be noted, was a wee bit of an understatement. A Mr. H. Moore, who lived a few miles outside of Bloomington, watched the grand spectacle with his family. Between 2:00 and 3:00 a.m. they witnessed a sky “almost covered with brilliant rays of many colors and of extraordinary beauty, running to a common center.” For Mr. Moore, it was “the most magnificent sight he ever saw in his life.” That same night someone from the Pantagraph, likely Publisher Williams Foote or Editor Edward J. Lewis, walked outside and, as a test, successfully read newsprint under the “auroral light.” The Pantagraph was a Republican Party newspaper in a highly charged partisan era (the Civil War was less than two years away), so the news story chosen for this special occasion ridiculed U.S. Sen. Stephen Douglas of Illinois, one of the nation’s leading Democrats. Midwestern skies have been lit up by periodic aurora borealis since then, such as one particularly strong event on Apr.16- 17, 1882. “Words fail to describe the intense and ever-varying beauty of the awe-inspiring spectacle,” remarked The Pantagraph that spring. This geomagnetic storm “practically rendered useless all telegraph wires from New York to Ogden [Utah].” On the whole, it was a tough day for the Western Union Telegraph Co. In one Chicago office, several operators burned their fingers on disconnected equipment. “Such was the force of the ‘element’ that several wires were burned off entirely, and the switchboard, upon which connections are made, caught fire on several occasions.” Some readers may recall the geomagnetic solar storm of March 1989 that caused power outages across a large swath of Quebec, leaving million of residents without power for upwards of nine hours. The aurora borealis from this event could be seen as far south as Texas. There have been near misses as well. In July 2012, a solar storm packing a punch on par with the two 1859 storms hurtled passed Earth in what was deemed a near miss. A few years ago the National Academy of Sciences studied the potential effects of another Carrington-level event if it were to occur today. Satellites, communication infrastructure and power grids would be at greatest risk. Technologically advanced though we may be, our civilization today is far less resilient and far more precarious than it was in 1859, given our dependence on electricity for … well everything. The Academy’s report predicted “extensive social and economic disruptions.” Blackouts in certain areas could last weeks. Damage estimates ran between $1 and $2 trillion (that’s trillion with a “t”). The appearance of sunspots (and thus solar storms) is cyclical, occurring every eleven years or so. The last solar cycle peaked in 2013. We can breathe easy for now. Yet when it comes to the next Big One, it’s not a question of if, but of when.",

    "content": "The startling success of electric automaker Rivian has shined an international spotlight on Bloomington-Normal. The company’s ever-sprawling plant on Normal’s west side also heralds the coming transportation revolution, as electric batteries replace the fossil-fuel burning, greenhouse gas-belching internal combustion engine. Yet it is worth noting that during the automobile industry’s formative years, during the first two decades of the twentieth century, electric cars enjoyed a level of acceptance and popularity not seen since, oh, right about now. “The electric vehicle always has been popular in Bloomington, the Baker, Waverly and other makes being sold here and driven by owners who want a light car for getting about town,” noted The Pantagraph in the spring of 1909. At the time, there were around 100 automobile owners in all of Bloomington. It is not known how many of them drove battery-powered “runabouts,” but two years later, in 1911, there were an estimated 30 electrics zipping up and down city streets. Back then, there was no shortage of Bloomington dealers selling electric autos. Keiser-Van Leer Co., for instance, sold the Baker Brougham, a “luxurious electric limousine,” while T.K. Hayes offered the Detroit Electric, a “speedy, powerful, thoroughly modern, electric-powered automobile.” Selling electric autos is one thing; designing and assembling them is a “whole ‘nother thing” altogether—just ask Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe! Even so—and though strange it may seem—Rivian is not the Twin City’s first foray into electric car manufacturing. Yes, before the space age R1T electric truck, there was the Henney Kilowatt, a battery-powered car engineered and assembled at the Eureka Williams Corp. plant in Bloomington. What’s that? You’ve never heard of the Henney Kilowatt? Well, that is understandable, as only 200 or fewer were ever made. That said, it is a fascinating story of a “car of tomorrow” that proved to be decades ahead of its time. A four-door subcompact, the Henney Kilowatt featured a repurposed Renault Dauphine car body—which gave the experimental car an even more idiosyncratic imprint. There were but two model years—1959 and 1960. The brainchild behind the Henney Kilowatt was C. Russell Feldmann, president of National Union Electric Co., a conglomerate that included the Henney Motor Co., Emerson Radio and Eureka Williams of Bloomington. Bloomington-based Eureka Williams got its start as Williams Oil-O-Matic, an early manufacturer of oil-burning home heaters. Its workforce quickly earned a reputation for its engineering acumen and precision machine work. In 1945, Williams Oil-O-Matic merged with Eureka Vacuum Cleaner Co. of Detroit, with all operations consolidating in Bloomington. National Union Electric, Eureka Williams’ parent company, viewed electric utilities as a ready market for its Henney Kilowatt prototype, as it was thought battery-powered vehicles were a perfect fit for the stop-and-go work of meter reading, bill collecting and the like. In addition, electric utilities were eager to promote (and often directly sold) electric appliances—from hair dryers to ranges. Electric cars dovetailed with this dream of an all-electric future and its captive citizen-consumers at the mercy of the local utility’s energy monopoly. Eureka Williams is credited with designing and building the car’s electric propulsion system, in consultation with early electric car pioneer Victor Wouk of the California Institute of Technology. The inaugural 1959 model was spectacularly underpowered by standards both then and now. Eighteen two-volt batteries and a seven-horsepower electric motor provided a top speed of 40 mph and a range of 40 miles. The 1960 model offered several improvements, with its twelve six-volt batteries boosting speeds and range to 60 mph and 60 miles respectively. Charging required an ordinary electric cord and household outlet, with a full charge taking eight to ten hours. Both model years were available in black, red and gray. In addition to electric utilities, the Henney Kilowatt was marketed to the general public as a family’s second car, good for shopping trips and in-town use. Yet even if one was willing to overlook its speed and range limitations, the steep $3,500 sticker price (or nearly $33,000 in today’s dollars) doomed the Henney Kilowatt’s market prospects. At any rate, Eureka Williams could not produce the cars cheap enough or fast enough to sell at the target price of $3,500. Utilities ended up purchasing most of the 46 or 47 Henney Kilowatts that were sold. Buyers included Atlantic City (N.J.) Electric Co.; Louisiana Power & Light Co. of New Orleans; and Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago. In the end, the 1960s were destined to be the decade not of the Henney Kilowatt and its successors, but rather the Ford Mustang, the Lincoln Continental, the Buick Riviera and their many hulking, gas-guzzling kin. For a decade and a half after the last Henney Kilowatt rolled off the Bloomington assembly line, unsold inventory—70 or so cars—“gathered dust” in a warehouse on South Center Street. That lot was then hauled away in the summer of 1975 to Tiffany Motor Corp. in Opa-locka, Fla. Today, there are some—but not many!— surviving Henney Kilowatts scattered across the country. The Swedish home appliance manufacturer AB Electrolux purchased National Union Electric and Eureka Williams in 1974, and the Eureka Co. remained a leading local employer for two more decades. In 2011, when Electrolux was closing its last offices in the Twin Cities, company officials invited the McLean County Museum of History to review—for potential donation—boxes of promotional material, scrapbooks, employee newsletters, newspaper clippings, correspondence and photographs. For several days museum staff sorted through the material before boxing much of it up and hauling it back to the museum archives. Included in this treasure trove were papers relating to the development and marketing of the Henney Kilowatt. Once at the museum, the boxes of donated items were further organized, inventoried, cataloged and placed in the climate-control archives. Today, the Eureka Williams and Henney Kilowatt collections are available to students, community residents, researchers, or anyone else with an interest in learning more. And speaking of learning more, McLean County Museum of History Librarian Bill Kemp is giving the illustrated program, \"Before Rivian: The Henney Kilowatt—Bloomington's Battery-powered Car of Tomorrow,\" on Saturday, March 26. This talk, which the museum hopes will be both in-person and online, will include dozens of rare or never-before-seen illustrations, promotional items, photographs, and more—all from the museum archives. To register, visit the museum’s website. Bill promises an electrifying, edifying time for all!",

    "content": "For 36 years, from 1876 to 1912, the tallest structure in the Twin Cities wasn’t a downtown Bloomington office building. No, towering above all else was a 200-foot-tall standpipe or water tower at the Bloomington waterworks, located on the north side of Division Street just west of what is now the Union Pacific Railroad / Amtrak line. To put 200 feet in perspective, the old standpipe was roughly two-thirds the height of Watterson Towers, the residence hall on the Illinois State University campus opened in 1969. Since the standpipe dominated the local skyline, it was a familiar sight for those traveling by rail between Chicago and St. Louis. For many passengers, Bloomington was simply known as the city with the remarkably tall standpipe (though it was far from the world’s tallest, as the local press was fond of boasting!) Like today’s much-larger, bulbous water towers, standpipes were designed, by way of height and gravity, to provide sufficient pressure to move water through underground mains to everything from fire hydrants to kitchen faucets. A common misconception is that standpipes were built to store water when pressure was usually the sole function. In its early decades, Bloomington suffered from the lack of a dependable municipal water supply. Landlocked with no sizable body of surface water nearby (Lake Bloomington wasn’t built until 1929-1930), residents relied on a patchwork system of public and private cisterns and wells. In times of drought, many wells ran dry, and cisterns were inadequate for fighting fires. In addition, wells could be contaminated from backyard privies, leading to periodic but deadly outbreaks of waterborne ailments such as dysentery and typhoid. In 1868, though, good news arrived in the form of a failed coal mine on Bloomington’s north side near Mason Street Investors abandoned the project because they had struck a rich “vein” of water and couldn’t pump it out fast enough to reach the coal. A heretofore unknown supply of water could now be tapped for municipal use, but it took the bone dry summer of 1874 to spur city officials into action, and soon thereafter they sunk a well in the same area as the abandoned mine shaft. This water could be pumped and impounded, but Bloomington lacked means to create pressure to move this water into homes, shops and factories. Accordingly, in August 1875, the city awarded the standpipe contract to A. V. Cool & Co. for $26,700 (or nearly $600,000 today, adjusted for inflation). Subcontractors for the project included Napoleon Heafer and James H. McGregor for brick masonry, and boilermakers William B. Maitland & Co. for the wrought-iron work. Local builders had never undertaken a project of this height and difficulty, and they were no doubt aware of botched attempts to erect standpipes in South Bend, Ind., Toledo, Ohio and elsewhere. The standpipe consisted of wrought-iron pipe housed in an octagonal tower and shaft of brick masonry. The wrought iron was “puddled, rolled and punched” by Heathcote & Co. of Williamsport, Penn., and the curved panels (three joined together would make one section of pipe) shipped by rail to Bloomington. It took William B. Maitland three months—mid-October 1875 to mid-January 1876—to assemble the panels and complete the entire length of the eight-foot diameter pipe. The iron sheeting became thinner the higher up it went—the first 20 feet were five-eighths of an inch thick with the seams double-riveted, for instance, while the top 52 feet were only three-sixteenth of an inch thick with single rivets. When completed, the standpipe held 34,092 gallons of water. To put that in perspective, the Town of Normal's water tower south of University High School—the one featuring Illinois State University’s Reggie Redbird—holds 500,000 gallons. Yet at 200 feet (or 201 feet—accounts vary!), the Bloomington structure was plenty high to generate enough water pressure for a modest-size city in the buckle of the Corn Belt. In fact, the local standpipe was significantly taller the iconic Chicago Water Tower, which famously survived the Great Fire of 1871. That Michigan Avenue beauty stands 154 feet tall, with the standpipe inside running 138 feet. And the historic Normal water tower or standpipe at Fell Park, which dates to 1898, reached 80 feet in height. It used to be topped by a 52-foot-high steel tank, but that came down in the mid-1970s. One of the more remarkable things about the Bloomington standpipe was that the city often allowed residents to visit the open-air viewing platform at the very top. Bordered by nothing more than a railing, it must’ve been a vertigo-inducing experience, especially on windy days. Not surprisingly, it was a tradition of sorts for residents, especially young folk, to carve their initials on the platform. To ascend the 200 feet to the top one had to tramp up the circular staircase of cast-iron risers and oak steps sandwiched between the brick masonry and the massive iron pipe. The main shaft included nine windows, each five feet high, so those making their way up or down the staircase could enjoy a variety of views. In February 1912, the city council acted upon a recommendation by Seth Noble, superintendent of the city water works, to demolish the old standpipe. After 36 years of service, it was worn-out and in disrepair, proving inadequate to serve the city needs. In March, the council awarded the demolition project to John Gray and his low bid of $3,100. “When it comes down,” The Pantagraph observed at the time, “people who have for years been accustomed to look for it when coming near to Bloomington will feel lost without it.” City officials, though, made sure Gray salvaged as much as possible from the razed structure for public need, and it was said some of the brickwork was used in a sewer line through O’Neil Park. James Hart, a longtime area versifier, titled one of his folksy poems “The Standpipe,” in which he recalled local residents asking Superintendant Noble for the key to get inside the tower so they could climb to the top. Hart wrote of those lucky enough to find themselves on the sky-high platform, gazing at the wider world around and underneath them: Sometimes their voices were wafted faintly, Or maybe someone’s hat came drifting down; We all believed an oft-repeated tale— Of a boy who once walked on the outer rail.",

    "content": "In the years following World War II, the remains of tens of thousands of American war dead returned stateside for reburial in hometown cemeteries. The jubilant return of servicemen in 1945 and 1946 was followed by a second wave of coffins. The Pantagraph reported the return of one local fallen son after another—sometimes as many as a half-dozen or more a week—well into the early 1950s. Many are buried at Park Hill Cemetery on Bloomington’s west side. The war was over but the bodies, so many bodies, kept coming back home. Memorial Day is a fitting time to recall this often-forgotten chapter of the war. Today, some 75 years after the fact, it’s hard to come to terms with the enormity of World War II. U.S. war dead, for instance, numbered more than 400,000. On May 16, 1948, the body of Pvt. Harold W. Morgan was buried at Park Hill Cemetery. He attended Irving Elementary, Bloomington High and Illinois State Normal University, and worked for the Alton Railroad at the time of his induction. As a machine gunner with the Fifth Marine Division, Morgan was killed in action on March 5, 1945, at Iwo Jima. The body of T. Sgt. Clifford A. Kwasigroh arrived in Bloomington on Aug. 3, 1948, and he was buried two days later at Park Hill Cemetery. He attended Ben Funk Consolidated School and Normal Community High School, and was a freshman at Illinois State Normal University at the time of his induction into the Army. Kwasigroh was sent to England in May 1944 as a radioman and gunner on a B-17 Liberator. As part of the Eighth Air Force, he completed 26 missions over Germany, but was killed on Jan. 5, 1945 when his bomber collided with another Allied plane over Bury St. Edmunds, England, during a training mission. Kwasigroh was initially buried at an American cemetery in Cambridge. Loren Deane Kane (see accompanying picture) attended Illinois State Normal University and worked in The Pantagraph’s news department before entering the Air Corps Reserves in 1942. As the radar observer in a P-61 Black Widow night fighter, he participated in 56 missions over New Guinea, the Philippines and elsewhere. On July 4, 1945, the 22-year-old airman was instantly killed in an early-morning runway crash. Second Lt. Kane was buried in a U.S. military cemetery on Sanga-Sanga Island, Philippines, before being brought back home. On Sept. 16, 1948, he was laid to rest a final time at Park Hill Cemetery on Bloomington’s west side. In March 1949, the bodies of brothers Sgt. Paul Johnson and Pfc. Guy S. Johnson were buried in Park Hill. Paul Johnson was killed in action on April 9, 1945, during an assault on a heavily fortified Japanese position on the island of Okinawa. His brother was killed on Nov. 24, 1944, in Saint-Laurent, Liege, Belgium, while serving with the 15th General Hospital. His until was hit by a German V-1 “buzz bomb,” the blast throwing the bodies of hospital personnel and patients 50 to 75 feet into the air. In late May 1949, The Pantagraph reported the return from the Mediterranean of the U.S. Army transport ship John L. McCarley that carried war dead previously buried in temporary military cemeteries in Italy and North Africa. Of the 2,554 bodies aboard, nine were returned at the request of next of kin living in Central Illinois. One of the dead was Staff Sgt. Harold P. Beitz of Bloomington, killed in Italy on Oct. 17, 1944, and buried at Park Hill on July 6, 1949. Funeral services for Bloomington resident Marvin W. Freeman were held at Park Hill on May 26, 1949. Before the war, he was a delivery boy for Roland’s, a downtown Bloomington department store. As first pilot for the B-17 bomber “Miss Ponca City,” Freeman’s Flying Fortress was shot down over Ruhland, Germany on Sept. 12, 1944. “We loved the boy and miss him,” read a Roland’s memorial to Freeman. “Almost unnoticed by the general public, groups of relatives and friends now gather in funeral homes over America to pay a last tribute to the boys whose remains are arriving for final burial. Sometimes the gatherings are pathetically small, so engrossed are people in today’s business and pleasure. Let us pause—and humbly try to comprehend their sublime spirit of sacrifice that led these boys through death to the undying quest of a free and peaceful world!” The body of Corp. William Bennett “Benny” Helm was brought back in May 1952 and buried at Camp Butler National Cemetery in Springfield. Helm was working at State Farm Insurance Cos. when he enlisted in the Army Air Force in 1940. He was at Clark Field in the Philippines when the Japanese surprise attacks began on Dec. 7, 1941. Captured along with thousands of other Allied soldiers, Helm died on June 28, 1942, in a Japanese prison camp. In October 1957, five years after Helm’s reburial, workmen breaking up some concrete at Brown’s auto parts store on the 400 block of North Main Street in Bloomington came across a bottle secreted away for posterity. Encased in concrete, the bottle held a typewritten list dated July 31, 1935. On it were 24 names associated with Nierstheimer’s, a grocery store formerly located at the site. This improvised time capsule also included a handwritten note from Benny Helm reading, “When you find this paper, look me up.” Although Helm had died more than fifteen years earlier in a prison camp 8,000 miles from home, his family and friends could find some measure of comfort knowing he was, at the very least, back home.",

    "content": "More than a century ago, Turner Hall was the cultural hub of Bloomington’s large and influential German community. Located on the 300 block of South Main Street and built in 1883, this three-story hall was home to the local chapter of the Turner Society, or Turnverein, an athletic and social club with the motto, “A sound mind in a sound body.” First organized in the Twin Cities in 1855, the Turnverein (roughly translated as “gymnastic association”) restricted membership to German-born Americans and their children. There were plenty of eligible families, though—in 1870, nearly 1 in 10 Bloomington residents were German-born. The city was home to German-organized Catholic, Lutheran, Methodist and Baptist churches, as well as Moses Montefiore Temple, a synagogue established by German Jews. There were a half-dozen or more German organizations, including Maennerchor, a singing society, Krieger Verein, a group of German army veterans, and even a German Masonic lodge. By the early 1880s, the Turners had outgrown a series of downtown clubrooms and halls. As such, George H. Miller, then in the employ of architect Henry A. Miner, drew up plans for a $22,000 stand-alone building (that total would be the equivalent of nearly $590,000 today, adjusted for inflation). Miller, of course, would go on to establish his own practice and have one of the more prolific architectural careers in Bloomington history. Turner Hall was much more than a gymnasium, as it accommodated all expressions of German life and culture. The main hall or auditorium (it was sometimes called the ballroom) was a “cozy and elegant opera house” with seating for 1,000 or more. It included a 25-foot-wide stage with scenery and a drop curtain, as well as a gallery or balcony that wrapped around much of the auditorium. The cloud ceiling frescos came from German-born, Peoria-based scenic painter Frank Dirkson, whose work appeared in internationally known venues, from Covent Garden in London to Theatre Royal in Montreal. “The fresco work is truly artistic,” noted the local press of Dirkson’s Turner Hall ceiling. “The whole culminates in a mass of fleecy clouds floating in an azure sky.” Hanging in the main hall was a “magnificent prismatic chandelier” of solid bronze and nickel festooned with 30 gas jets. Directly under the auditorium was a 3,100-plus square foot gymnasium with 22-foot-high ceilings. The building also included a barroom, dinning room, kitchen, a room for playing chess, a ladies’ parlor and a “gentlemen’s retiring room.” Turner Hall’s formal dedication took place Monday evening, December 10, 1883. The program kicked off with a torchlight procession of some 100 Turners and their supporters marching from downtown to their new home. Most of the dedicatory speeches were in German. “Believe me,” declared Turner president Christian Riebsame, “that while we love to cherish the memories, the habits and customs of our fatherland, and cling with revered fondness to our mother tongue, it is our aim and ambition at all times to be as good citizens of the land of our adoption as it is your pride and glory to be Americans to the manor born.” The new building was used for a wide range of Turner events, including dances, dinners, theatrical productions and holiday parties. Yet gymnastics remained a centerpiece of the organization’s philosophy of personal and community betterment. The Christmas ball of 1889, for instance, featured a human pyramid exhibition of 20 Turners dressed as Santa Claus. Adolph Mols, an 1891 graduate of the Turnverein’s own Normal College of the American Gymnastic Union of Indianapolis, led classes for local Turner children. Mols then played an instrumental role organizing the physical education curriculum for Bloomington schools. The Turners were an inclusive bunch, with a membership that included Protestants, Catholics and Jews, as well as those from the working, middle and upper classes. Franz “Frank” E. Peckman, who died in early 1893 while serving his second term as president of the Bloomington Turners, was in his mid-twenties when he came to Bloomington from the fatherland. He was first a cigarmaker, and then worked at the Chicago & Alton Railroad Shops before opening a grocery store on 1100 block of South Main Street. In 1911-1912, with the immigrant generation dying off, the Turners sold their hall to the Bloomington chapter (or aerie) of the Fraternal Order of Eagles. Though now without a building of their own, the local Turners, led by second-generation German Americans, remained active in the Twin Cities for another three decades. When the U.S. entered the First World War, anti-German hysteria swept the nation. Local “superpatriots” succeeded in expunging the German language from churches and schools, as well as printed material like the Bloomington Journal, a weekly German newspaper. In April 1918, the Turnverein changed its name to the Columbia Fraternal Society, an “all-American” revision made in “the spirit of the hour.” The panic eventually subsided, and after the war the Turners reverted to their Old World name once again. The local chapter eventually occupied the entire third floor of the Wood Building, 108-110 E. Front St. The society celebrated its eightieth anniversary in April 1935, with Carl Jaeger, Anton Dietrich, Gerhard Ullman and John B. Gummerman serving in leadership posts. “Once an aggressive organization sponsoring physical and cultural well being, the Turnverein is now a purely social organization,” remarked The Pantagraph. At this time, the Turners held picnics near Downs along Kickapoo Creek, or in Randolph south of Bloomington. “There were tables, an ice-filled tub with a keg of beer, another with soft drinks for the kids, and a third tub for rinsing the tin cups used for beer,” remembered William Adams, who as a young boy attended Turner gatherings, and then wrote a 1998 history of the local society. The last picnic was probably held in 1947. In its latter years, the 1883 Turner Hall building was partially obscured by the erection of the Main Street viaduct bridge. Another blow to the building’s prestige was its later use as a warehouse for Stern’s, a downtown furniture store. In 1966, Pantagraph reporter Jim Engelhorn visited the abandoned hall. “Inside now the floors are rotting and the plaster is dropping off the walls,” he wrote. “Murals in the ballroom are peeling. Broken glass and pigeon droppings make it a ballet dancer’s challenge to thread a path to the ballroom.” The grand old building was torn down in 1969, and the site became a surface parking lot.",

    "content": "Novelist, poet, essayist and farmer Wendell Berry has said that we live in a time of “punishment and ruins.” This is certainly true when one considers the lost landscape of the tallgrass prairie in Central Illinois. In McLean County alone, some 670,000 acres of prairie—an area roughly the size of Rhode Island—has been lost to agriculture and urbanization. All that’s left of this indescribably magnificent landscape is a five acre vestige in northern McLean County, as well as a few tiny, scattered strips found along old railroad right-of-ways and similarly neglected ground far removed from the rapacious commercialization and commodification of our age. The story is much the same—or even bleaker—in other agriculture intensive counties of Central Illinois, including Champaign, DeWitt, Livingston and Logan. Statewide, of some 22 million acres of original “virgin” prairie, only 2,300 acres remain. That’s about 100th of 1 percent, which means that, on one level at least, calling Illinois the Prairie State is little more than a cruel joke. This forever lost world featured uninterrupted miles of big and little blue stem, blue-eyed drop seed, yellow star and other grasses, blowing in the wind, it was said, like waves upon a shoreless sea. But interwoven among this yellow, green and brown palate was a riot of color. From April to the autumn freeze, the Grand Prairie of Central Illinois was dotted—sometime carpeted—with a seemingly infinite profusion of multihued perennial flowers. One can get a glimpse—albeit a faint glimpse—of this vanished landscape at Weston Prairie Cemetery Nature Preserve, a 5.24 acre stand of tallgrass prairie in northern McLean County, along U.S. Route 24 between Chenoa and Fairbury. Beginning in mid-April and into May, the first prairie plants that flower begin show their colors on the old pioneer cemetery grounds. The early arrivals include prairie violet (Viola pedatifida), white blue-eyed grass (Sisyrinchium albidum), golden Alexander (Zizia aurea), hoary puccoon (Lithospermum canescens), lousewort (Pedicularis Canadensis), violet wood sorrel (Oxalis violacea), shooting star (Dodecatheon meadia), wild strawberry (Fragaria virginiana) and others. By Roger Anderson’s count, distinguished professor emeritus, Illinois State University School of Biological Sciences, Weston Cemetery Prairie contains no less than 71 native prairie plant species—all on little more than five acres! As these prairie forbs (non-grass species) have their “day in the sun,” so to speak, they give way to other flowering plants, so the prairie remains in perpetual bloom into the late autumn. “Prairie plants tend to stagger their flowering times so that competition for pollinators can be reduced,” noted Anderson and biologist Stephen Schelfhout of Illinois Wesleyan University in a 1980 paper. Weston Cemetery Prairie is owned by Yates Township and managed by ParkLands Foundation. This past Tuesday, ParkLands staff and volunteers staged a controlled burn on the eastern half of the prairie (one-half of the preserve is burned every year on a rotating basis.) Prairie fires release nutrients into the soil, and the blackened earth warms more quickly than undisturbed prairie, furthering new growth. Today, the eastern half, at least to the untrained eye, looks like a wasteland of soot and ash. Yet the deep fibrous roots survive and thrive after fire, and so by summertime, the scorched acreage will be thriving once more with a great profusion of grasses, flowers, insect life, small mammals and other wild things. Throughout the latter half of the 19th century, there still remained a fair amount of unplowed, relatively undisturbed prairie in Mclean County, from the edges of lightly traveled county roads to soggy, hard-to-drain acreage. “The native wild prairie flowers are very plentiful and beautiful in this neighborhood at present,” noted the Sept. 25, 1895 Pantagraph, “neighborhood” in this instance meaning Bloomington and the surrounding environs. “The seasonable weather has made a larger bloom than has been seen here for many years. Many persons who drive in the country load their vehicles with them and bring them to their homes.” Yet such scenes became increasingly rare into the 20th century, especially with the mechanization and industrialization of the Corn Belt and the introduction of commercial fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides. In the late 1930s, Dr. Blanche McAvoy, assistant professor of biological science education at Illinois State Normal University, began taking her students out to a stretch of Illinois Central Railroad right-of-way just south of Kerrick, a grain elevator siding between Normal and Hudson. They trekked out there, some two-plus miles north of campus, to check out a small strip of original tallgrass prairie. In 1944, this acreage, described as a half a mile long and 100 feet wide on both the east and west sides of the IC tracks, as well as some buffer farmland, were set aside as a “prairie preserve.” Unfortunately, it appears that plans to formally protect this preserve through legal agreements, statutory provisions or other protective measures never materialized. Nonetheless, despite the onslaught of 20th century indifference and neglect, remnant prairie plants containing irreplaceable original genetic material from this preserve survive into the present. And because the Illinois Central rail bed is now the main branch of Constitution Trail, the area is much more accessible than it was eight decades earlier for Dr. McAvoy and her biology teachers-in-training. R. Given Harper, the George C. and Ella Beach Lewis Endowed Chair of Biology at Illinois Wesleyan University, tells us that today prairie plants can still be seen on the east side of Constitution Trail north of Northtown Road to the Kerrick parking lot and trail access point. At one time, there was signage indicating restored prairie along this stretch, though knowing its earlier history, it’s likely “virgin” or “remnant” would have been more accurate and biologically significant than “restored.” There are other such glimpses of the lost prairie in the immediate area. The west side leg of Constitution Trail known as the Interurban Branch, for instance, features remnant prairie plants from the Route 9 wayside to the Interstate 55 / 74 bridge over West Washington Street. We should be grateful for such gifts; treasure them for the pleasures they give and the lessons they offer. Such remnants also stand witness to nearly two centuries of wanton destruction and irreparable loss. In 1831, Abraham W. and Mary Goodpasture Carlock settled in White Oak Grove in present day Woodford County. When the Carlocks arrived, “there was not a fence or house or building of any kind” on the prairie stretching approximately twelve miles between their place and Bloomington, the seat of newly formed McLean County. Abraham and Mary’s son William B. Carlock, born in 1842, wistfully brought to mind this lost landscape in 1926, two years before his death. “The virgin prairies throughout the state during the months of June, July and August presented a most beautiful and delightful appearance,” he recalled. “A sunrise in the morning when the grass and flowers covered with a heavy dew or light rain reflected the prismatic colors, mingled with such beauty as no human tongue could describe.” “One’s imagination of paradise,” he concluded, “could not be more glorious than these prairie scenes.”",

    "content": "For much of its first 100 years, Bloomington’s formerly unreliable water supply threatened to hold back the city’s growth and industrial development. Pumped from a string of relatively shallow wells, the water was highly mineralized, making it one of the hardest and most unpalatable municipal supplies in the state. The city also struggled to pump enough to meet industrial and residential demand, and water shortages, especially in the summer months, were not uncommon. Although local government and business leaders long fretted over the city’s water woes, it wasn’t until 1920 and a deadly typhoid epidemic at the Chicago & Alton Railroad Shops that the issue squarely became one of life and death. This outbreak lent much-needed urgency to solve the costly and technically difficult problem of establishing a safe, secure, and long-term supply. In the end, the answer was the creation (in 1929-1930) of Lake Bloomington, a reservoir that continues today to slack the city’s thirst. Typhoid, caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi, is often contracted when sewage contaminates drinking water. A three-year epidemic in the early 1890s in Chicago claimed almost 4,500 lives. For decades typhoid was a frequent and often deadly visitor to Bloomington, though the early 1920 outbreak was likely the largest in city history. From January through March 1920, tainted water sickened about 800 C&A shopmen, according to an estimate by the Illinois Department of Public Health. Most suffered from serious (though nonfatal) intestinal ailments, while a small percentage came down with full-blown typhoid. In the end, the three-month epidemic left 24 dead. Beginning in the post-Civil War years, the westside C&A Shops were the city’s largest employer. At the time of the outbreak there were some 1,200 men building and repairing steam locomotives and rolling stock, from boxcars to cabooses. The sprawling facility included a roundhouse, locomotive repair shop, foundry, paint shop, wheel and axle shop, powerhouse, offices and rail yards. There were blacksmiths, boilermakers, machinists, carpenters, upholsters, sheet metal workers, crane operators, painters and others. Bloomington had only recently established the position of health director, and it was readily apparent that Dr. J.M. Furstman had neither the staff nor budget to tackle an outbreak of this magnitude. The first cases were reported in January, and early on some thought that the “Alton sick” (as it was called) might be influenza. However, an increasingly large number of shop workers bedridden with severe diarrhea caught the notice of Furstman and he began an investigation on or around February 10. At the time, the Bloomington Daily Bulletin newspaper reported that 300 C&A employees were “off duty,” either sick or caring for sick family members. Even at this early point in the outbreak, city officials and the local press knew well enough to suspect polluted drinking water as the source of the problem. Those who succumbed to the outbreak were mourned. On Sunday, February 15, the funeral for 52-year-old C&A blacksmith Richard J. Kelly was held at St. Patrick’s Church. Rev. M.J. O’Callaghan held services, and The Bulletin reported that it was the largest funeral in quite a while at the Irish Catholic parish on the city’s working class west side. “Throughout the vast industrial plant,” the paper eulogized, “there is genuine regret in the realization that Dick Kelly will no more don his apron at the blacksmith forge where he had worked so many years.” The state health department arrived at the C&A Shops around February 17, quickly realizing that the widespread incidence of diarrhea pointed to a looming typhoid epidemic. Many workers were experiencing intermittent or acute dysentery, vomiting and fevers as high as 104 degrees. Four C&A workers died between the night of Saturday, February 21, and the following day. The dead included boilermaker Harry Granbeck and machinist John Carlson. By the end of that weekend the death toll had reached seventeen. The state conducted two postmortem examinations in early March and confirmed the existence of typhoid. By the end of the month, 22 C&A employees were dead, with 15 of those attributed to typhoid and the other 7 influenza or pneumonia, though with the latter group it’s likely bad water was a “contributory cause” of death. That the shops remained opened even as employees sickened and died speaks to how railroad officials were often grossly negligent when it came to the health and safety of their employees. To supplement the often-inadequate flow of city water, the C&A relied on what was called the “industrial” supply, pumped directly from nearby Sugar Creek or pulled from wells south of the Shops. In either case, this water was not fit for human consumption, and instead was used for things like toilets, blacksmith slack tubs and locomotive boilers. State investigators eventually determined that the source of the outbreak was a cross-connection (or what was called an “interconnection”) between one set of pipes carrying city water and another carrying the industrial supply. The culprit was a leaky four-inch valve that was supposed to separate the good water from the bad. Even after identifying the source, C&A management dragged their feet on correcting the problem. On March 15, infuriated C&A employees walked off the job, insisting on a new set of pipes to ensure the safety of the water supply. “Such conditions cannot be tolerated by any person, whether he be a minister, mayor, or mechanic,” read a statement by labor leaders to the public, “and so we respectfully solicit the help and moral influence of our fair-minded citizens, to the end that such conditions and the causes of the same be justly dealt with and eradicated from this community.” Striking workers held up a passenger train in front of C&A General Superintendent W.H. Penrith’s office, and it’s said they followed that up by chasing him out of tow! The strike ended March 24 after C&A President W.G. Bierd agreed to install new drinking water pipes entirely separate from the industrial supply, though he balked at the demand to sack two C&A officials who labor leaders believed were most culpable in the outbreak. In early June, the railroad was ready to settle claims brought by sickened workers and family members who lost a husband, son or father. Hearings before Daniel J. May, arbitrator for the Illinois Industrial Commission, began June 8. For death claims, May generally awarded $3,500 (or nearly $43,000 in today’s dollars, adjusted for inflation) to C&A widows, with an additional $250 for each minor child or dependent.",

    "content": "“It is very seldom that a town of some 350 inhabitants can boast of an up-to-date hospital,” declared a spring 1923 advertisement for Dr. L.M. Johnson Hospital in Arrowsmith. The “wonderful little home for the sick” opened in 1921 and remained a fixture in this eastern McLean County community into the 1940s. The hospital had the appearance of little more than an oversized bungalow (see accompanying image.) Initially, the steam-heated facility accommodated five patients and featured “a modern operating room,” X-ray equipment, offices and a kitchen By 1928, Johnson Hospital could care for 15 patients, though it rarely had more than a few at any one time. Born and raised in the Henry County, Ill. town of Annawan, Dr. Lyford McChesney Johnson came to Arrowsmith in 1903 to “hang his shingle.” As a graduate of the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Chicago, Johnson was no slouch. “He has taken postgraduate work in surgery and is among the progressive men of his profession,” noted a biographical sketch written a few years after the hospital’s opening. His medical library was said to be one of the best in all downstate. While practicing medicine in Arrowsmith, he was also on the staffs of St. Joseph’s, Brokaw and Mennonite hospitals in the Twin Cities (the latter two have since merged.) In 1921, Dr. Johnson opened his namesake hospital on West Crosson Street in Arrowsmith on the former site of O.T. Mill’s livery stable. At the hospital, he received occasional assistance from other physicians and surgeons, such as Dr. Rayden Arthur Laing of Ellsworth. Long before small-town America was hollowed out by department store chains, big box stores, online commerce and other vagaries and brute efficiencies of capitalism, communities such as Arrowsmith were vibrant trading centers. In 1928, the small Corn Belt village, with just under 350 residents, was home to Krum and Krum Lumber Co., Frank Virgiel’s grocery and hardware store, O.T. Mills’ restaurant, L.E. Daley’s dry goods and grocery, L.D. Witt’s meat market, J.E. Bunn’s blacksmith shop, Lester Dawson’s feed store, Arrowsmith State Bank, and other businesses. At the time, the community was still served by rail passenger service through the Lake Erie & Western Railroad, then a part of the Nickel Plate Road. Two years after settling in Arrowsmith, Johnson’s wife Caroline Gless gave birth to their only child, Ethel Melba. Raised in Arrowsmith, Ethel graduated from Arrowsmith High in 1923 before going on to earn a master’s degree from Northwestern University and eventually head Illinois Wesleyan’s drama and theater departments. The Arrowsmith hospital surely saved the lives of more than a few eastern McLean County residents. Johnson performed appendectomies from time to time, including one on Apr. 10, 1934 on the Rev. W.F. Powell of Arrowsmith’s Methodist Episcopal Church. The good reverend was serving as an election board clerk when he became ill. He was first taken to his home and then the hospital, where during a thunderstorm and a power outage Dr. Johnson performed a tricky but successful operation. The hospital, by virtue of the business it was in, was naturally a place of death and dying. Thirty-three year old Mattie Bridgewater was brought to the hospital on Apr. 5, 1926, where she passed away two days later “following an emergency appendicitis operation.” She left a husband, Ray, and three children, Mabel, age 12, Virginia, 10, and John Thomas, 3. The Bridgewaters farmed southeast of Arrowsmith. If death was an occasional visitor to the small country hospital, it was also a place that welcomed new life, as Dr. Johnson delivered many babies. The first came on Nov. 18, 1921, when Pearl Tanner Kyle gave birth to a daughter, Lucille. When Helen Dorene was born to Dollie and Paul Jenkins on Dec. 31, 1926, she joined three other newborns at the hospital. Farming has always been a dangerous occupation, and the hospital treated those injured on the job. On Jun. 14, 1933, William Gabe Savage, a 50-year-old farmer outside of Arrowsmith, was kicked by a horse he was trying to harness, suffering what were believed at first to be fatal internal injuries. He was taken to Johnson Hospital, and after an operation on a punctured intestine, he remained under the care of staff for another two weeks before being sent home. On Sep. 26, 1940, 61-year-old Sam J. Crago, a stock buyer and farmer southeast of Ellsworth, was thrown under a wagon by a spooked team. He received head and spinal injuries and died at Dr. Johnson’s hospital four days later. The Arrowsmith institution treated its share of automobile accident victims, located as it was just 2½ miles south of Illinois Route 9. On May 8, 1927, members of the Vielhak family of Peoria were traveling on Route 9 when they collided with another auto two miles east of Arrowsmith. Emma Vielhak and her daughter Edna were the only ones to sustain serious injuries. With a broken pelvic bone, Edna’s stay at the hospital lasted several weeks. All sorts of mishaps brought folks to the hospital. On Jul 21, 1930, Leslie Clark, a 23-year-old Stanford man, was struck by lightning while working for a tiling crew. “He is under treatment at the Johnson Hospital where attendants have expressed a fear that the partial paralysis of his right side might continue for a year,” reported The Pantagraph. The collections of the McLean County Museum of History include an Illinois Department of Public Health license issued to Johnson Hospital. The license, dated May 18, 1940, certified that the institution had “qualified staff and adequate facilities” to operate a “lying-in” hospital. Dr. Lyford M. Johnson passed away on May 1, 1948, at St. Joseph’s Hospital in Bloomington, where he had been a patient for two months. He was 67 years old. The cause of death was listed as diabetes mellitus. “The hospital, privately owned and operated, was one of the greatest things that ever happened to Arrowsmith,” noted a history of the village published for its centennial (1871-1971). After closing, the former hospital building was transformed into the DeArms Nursing Home, owned and operated by Mary DeArms Murillo. Then, in 1971, it became Russell’s Manor, housing mentally and physically disabled adults. Owner James P. Russell closed for good in the summer of 1976 after state inspectors cited the home for a series of health and safety violations. Today, the old hospital is a private, single family residence. Since Dr. Johnson’s passing—more than seven decades ago—Arrowsmith has not had a full-time physician.",

    "content": "U.S. President Ronald Reagan was no stranger to Bloomington-Normal, though most of his visits occurred decades before he reached the White House to become one of the defining political figures of the 20th century. “Dutch” Reagan, as he was known during his school years, attended nearby Eureka College from 1928 until his graduation in 1932. As a member of the football team he competed in home and away games against both Illinois State Normal University and Illinois Wesleyan. After Eureka, the Illinois native embarked on a radio career and, through a combination of luck, pluck and good looks, became a second-tier silver screen star, appearing in the likes of “Knute Rockne All American” and “Bedtime for Bonzo.” Reagan then returned to the Twin Cities in October 1955 and January 1961, serving on both occasions as a celebrity spokesperson for the postwar corporate behemoth General Electric. Reagan’s years with GE are often overlooked, though they were crucial to his evolution from a Franklin Roosevelt New Deal Democrat to an unapologetic conservative bent on realigning the Republican Party along the lines of right-wing ideologue Barry Goldwater. Back in the fall of 1954, with his movie career on the wane and middle class America embracing television as the entertainment medium of the future, Reagan became the host of “General Electric Theater,” a new anthology series airing Sunday nights on CBS. By the 1956-1957 season, it was the third highest rated program in all TV land, trailing only fellow CBS offerings “The Ed Sullivan Show” and “I Love Lucy.” Along with his TV hosting duties—a gig he would hold for eight years—Reagan also served as GE’s “traveling ambassador.” As the public face of one of the largest and most powerful corporations in the postwar era, Reagan spent upwards of twelve weeks a year crisscrossing the country to make extended public relations stops at GE research and manufacturing plants. All told, he visited 139 facilities in 40 states, including the plant in Bloomington, which opened in 1955. It’s believed that during those eight years on the road he met or addressed most of GE’s 250,000 employees. Reagan honed his formidable skills as the “Great Communicator” by spending hundreds of hours chatting with GE factory hands and management, signing autographs, telling and retelling stories of Hollywood glamour and fame, and speaking on the “mashed potatoes circuit” to community groups and clubs on the threats of communism abroad and “creeping socialism” at home. “This transformative, eight-year period in his life remains underexamined,” argued political journalist Jacob Weisberg in his 2016 study of Reagan’s presidency. For his part, Reagan came to view his time with GE as a “post-graduate education in political science,” adding that “it wasn’t a bad apprenticeship for someone who’d someday enter public life.” Reagan first came to Bloomington as GE’s “traveling ambassador” on October 19, 1955. General Electric was one of the first employers to locate along what was then known as the Route 66 “beltline” (today’s Veterans Parkway). In Bloomington, GE engineers and those on the shop floor designed and manufactured all types of electrical switches and controls. At the time of Reagan’s visit, the newly opened plant employed 1,600 men and women, with the latter comprising about 40 percent of the workforce. During their stay, the former Hollywood B-lister and his second wife Nancy Davis spent two nights at the Prairie Traveler Motel, located across the beltline from the GE plant. The whirlwind stopover included a private dinner with GE management and local business and community leaders, a cocktail party at Bloomington Country Club, an interview with local TV station WBLN, and a breakfast talk at the Rogers Hotel, among a half-dozen other commitments. Reagan spent his first morning in the Twin Cities with the plant’s first shift, playing the role of the “celluloid idol” all the while telling employees that he was “hired help” just like them. He left the factory to speak at a Rotary Club luncheon, where he talked about battling communism in Hollywood as president of the Screen Actors Guild (what Reagan didn’t say—and what nobody in the audience would’ve known—was that during his Hollywood years he was also an informer for the FBI.) After addressing the local Rotarians, the seemingly tireless Reagan returned to the GE plant to meet and greet the second shift. “The Hollywood star and TV actor could pass for a young business executive,” noted Helen Rorabach, The Pantagraph’s social editor who traveled with him as he made the rounds. “He is friendly, intelligent and smart enough to show an interest in others. He has a keen sense of humor which shows itself in the Irish twinkle in his eyes.” The television host and GE spokesperson returned to Central Illinois periodically in the latter half of the 1950s and into the 1960s. On June 9, 1957, for example, a 46-year-old Reagan delivered the keynote address at Eureka College’s commencement. “One of the strongest defense points against the trends to more government is the small liberal arts college,” he declared. “Here, without fear of political reprisal, can be kept alive the principles of individuality, enterprise and courage we have inherited.” For Reagan, there was no greater threat to personal liberty than the federal leviathan and its bureaucratic and regulatory stranglehold over a free people and the free enterprise system. “We must remember that there is not a single service or security provided by the government that does not have to be paid for in loss of certain personal freedoms,” he said. Reagan was back in the Twin Cities in January 1961 to deliver a fiery defense of laissez-faire capitalism before the 60th annual banquet of the Association of Commerce (now the Mclean County Chamber of Commerce.) The Eureka College graduate couldn’t help but open his A of C address with nostalgic nod to the past. “Being here reminds me of some bruises I absorbed on the football fields of Normal and Wesleyan,” he joked. Yet the Reagan of neighborly, Midwestern charm soon gave way to one full of doom-and-gloom and under siege. His “grin turned grim,” is how Pantagraph reporter Tim Gumbrell described the transformation The nation, Reagan warned, faced an existential threat from fellow citizens—many working within the federal government—who sought to undermine American capitalism and exceptionalism. “We’re not at peace, we’re at war, and it’s a war we might lose because we don’t know we’re in it,” he threatened menacingly. “Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We must save it now or spend our sunset years telling our children and our children’s children what it was like when men were free.” Reagan would go on to serve as California governor from 1967 to 1975. In October 1980, one month before winning the presidential election, he returned to the Twin Cities to participate in ISU’s homecoming parade.",

    "content": "“The most American thing in America.” That’s what Theodore Roosevelt said of the Chautauqua movement, the popular, week-long outdoor gatherings in the late 19th and early 20th century that were part church camp meeting, part civics class and part county fair. In the Twin Cities, there was a Chautauqua most years from the early 1890s into the late 1920s. City and country folk alike flocked to the local Chautauqua grounds to be enlightened by speakers, uplifted by musicians and entertained by various performers. Some attendees would spend the day there, while plenty of others pitched tents and made a week of it. “The programs consisted of bands, orchestras, singing organizations, play companies, [African-American] jubilee singers, Swiss bell ringers, lecturers, impersonators, readers, magicians, and many other features,” observed Chautauqua promoter J. Oscar Hall of Bloomington in a reminiscence from 1950. “Religious services on Sunday, story hours for the children, nature study sessions, cooking demonstrations and health talks were featured on many programs.” In 1874, Methodist minister John Heyl Vincent staged a new type of religious and educational gathering at Chautauqua Lake (hence the movement’s name) in western upstate New York. The “Mother Chautauqua,” as it became known, spawned many hundreds of “daughter” Chautauquas throughout the nation, including those in Bloomington-Normal. It appears that the Twin City’s first full-blown Chautauqua was held in 1892. Organizers J.W. Haggard and James H. Shaw staged their ambitious sixteen-day affair, Jul. 23 to Aug. 7, on ten acres between Bloomington and Normal, along the streetcar line connecting the two communities. They called their temporary Chautauqua ground “Midway Park,” which was likely somewhere on or near what’s today the Advocate BroMenn Medical Center complex. The lecturers and entertainers that summer 127 years ago included Gen. John C. Black, a Civil War regimental commander and Democratic congressman; Judge W.G. Ewing of Bloomington; temperance activist John Sobieski; The Alabamans, a “colored glee club;” the local DeMolay Band; and many others. Christian living as a force for personal and societal betterment was a common subject for many a Chautauqua speaker. Temperance was another perennially popular topic. There were also inspirational talks, and those that specialized in travel, current events, and progressive reform causes, the latter including child labor and welfare, women’s suffrage and the humane treatment and rehabilitation of prisoners. “Under pleasant surroundings and refining influences,” declared the organizers of the Bloomington Chautauqua., “those who attend have an opportunity to hear the great orators of the time and to come in touch with the best educators of the country, to improve themselves and to gain new ideas and inspiring thoughts.” The Chautauqua returned to Midway Park the following year, with speakers including the suffragist Susan B. Anthony. “She must do her own work and vote her own belief,” Anthony said of American women, “and in that way act as a human being which she did not when she delegated these things to others to do for her.” In 1895, if not earlier, the local Chautauqua picked up stakes and moved to Houghton Lake, a popular pleasure ground located just south of Bloomington (State Farm Insurance purchased these grounds in 1948 for use by its employees and their families.) The big draw for the Jul. 26 to Aug. 4, 1901 Bloomington Chautauqua was William Jennings Bryan, populist leader and past and future Democratic Party presidential candidate. James Shaw, the organizer of this and the next half-dozen or so local Chautauquas, had a large tent erected on the Houghton Lake grounds to serve as the principal venue for the nine-day affair. Shaw also invited the public to campout near the lake. “The park contains 40 acres of ground, is densely shaded with immense trees,” noted a Bloomington Chautauqua program, “[it] has a large artificial lake, suitable for boating, bathing, and fishing, towards which the ground gently slopes, making it a very desirable place of tenting, attractive and healthful in every respect.” Railroads and streetcar companies, interested in boosting ridership, played an instrumental role in the promotion and success of the Chautauqua movement. Locally, the Bloomington & Normal Railway Co. extended its streetcar service to the Houghton Lake grounds. Not only that, but in time for the 1902 Chautauqua, the transit company built a wood-frame, open-air pavilion at the lake large enough to seat 2,000. On the most crowded day of the 1902 Chautauqua, eight streetcars ran between the courthouse square and the park grounds, but even that wasn’t enough to handle the crush of riders. One of the speakers that year was Carrie Nation, the hatchet-wielding temperance radical. “I tell you, friends, it is smash or be smashed, and I would rather smash,” she declared in Bloomington. After he bought out Bloomington Chautauqua promoter James Shaw around 1908, James L. Loar partnered with J. Oscar Hall. The two of them operated Bloomington-based Loar Independent Chautauqua Co., which served as booking agents and promoters for not only the local Chautauqua, but for some 100 others throughout the Midwest. For the Jul. 8-14, 1917 Chautauqua at Lake Park (as Houghton Lake was now called), there were two 50-cent days, three 35-cent days and two bargain 25-cent days (to put this in perspective, 35 cents at that time would be the equivalent of $7 today, adjusted for inflation.) The Twin Cities were without a Chautauqua for several years until James Loar and the Bloomington Kiwanis Club began staging smaller such gatherings on the Illinois Wesleyan University campus. A Chautauqua of this sort then continued at IWU into the late 1920s. In the end, the Chautauqua movement could not compete for the public’s attention and dollars against the onslaught of new forms of electronic mass entertainment—namely motion pictures and radio. “It seems that almost everybody went to the Chautauqua,” recalled J. Oscar Hall in his 1950 reminiscence, “farmers came in their buggies and farm wagons,—the rich and poor, the educated and uneducated, the old men and elderly ladies, the boys with their girlfriends, and mothers with babes in their arms, all flocked to the Chautauqua.” “It was,” he concluded, “truly ‘A Peoples’ Chautauqua.’”",

    "content": "On the western edge of downtown, the no-frills, mom-and-pop Butler House was an old friend to the weary traveler and local resident alike. The hotel doubled as an economy boarding house, so its ambiance was always more welcoming, working class and west side than its more stylish downtown competitors. For some 35 years, John Preston “Press” Butler, his wife Elizabeth “Lizzie” Kavanaugh Butler and their adult children owned and operated the place, which also served as their family home. Located at the northwest corner of Madison and Front streets, the three-story, wood-frame hotel already had a rich history before the Butlers came into the picture in the mid-1880s. It appears the hotel opened for business way back in 1856 or 1857, in the decade before the Civil War, and was first known as the Bronson House and then the Denman House. In its early years, the hotel regularly changed hands, and for a long time it was known as the St. Nicholas Hotel. Press and Lizzie Butler began running the hotel in 1884-1885, changing its name from the Wait’s New Hotel (its most recent incarnation) to the Butler House In the latter half of the 19th century there were few Bloomington residents as intriguing as Press Butler. “He weighs not over 130 pounds, is short in stature, and of slender build, with black hair and eyes, and a swarthy mustache and goatee,” noted The Pantagraph. “He is the impersonation of self-reliance, grit, and cool courage. His nerve and pluck have been tested time and again, and have never failed.” Butler first gained a local reputation as a daring Bloomington firefighter in the era of volunteer companies. By the mid-1880s, he was a private detective of considerable fame. His exploits included a lengthy gun battle at Bloomington’s west side Union Depot ending in the capture (and eventual conviction and imprisonment) of a “notorious forger and safe-blower.” In 1888, the Butlers erected a handsome four-story brick addition to their hotel facing Madison Street. The 24-room north side addition was designed by Bloomington architect George H. Miller, whose many local buildings include the old Moses Montefiore Temple on Prairie Street, and the Central Fire Station (now Epiphany Farms Restaurant) on Front Street. With the George Miller addition, the Butler House offered 64 rooms, as well as a “bar, billiard room, and barber shop.” Even so, the original part of the hotel, in all its creaky, wood-frame antebellum glory, meant that the Butler place was never a direct competitor to the larger and finer hotels of sturdy brick in the heart of downtown, such as the Ashley House on the northwest corner of the courthouse square, and the Phoenix Hotel on Center Street between Jefferson and Monroe. In July 1887, a Hoopeston, Ill., baseball club traveled to Bloomington for a scheduled game against the local “nine.” It was the practice back then for the hometown boys to cover the visitors’ hotel and traveling expenses. “They stopped at the Butler House, but desired a high-priced house, and accordingly moved to the Phoenix,” recounted The Pantagraph. “The Bloomington management refused to pay the difference, and the ‘Hoopestons’ paid their own bill and left the account in the hands of [McLean County] Judge [Colostin] Myers to collect.” Perhaps because of its well-worn appearance and casual atmosphere, the Butler House had a reputation for attracting colorful characters. In early Dec. 1893, for example, circus great William Sparks, aka the “American Hercules,” “breathed his last” in one of the rooms. Sparks, known for the “cannon ball act,” traveled with Barnum, Ringling and other top-tier circuses for three decades. According to The Pantagraph, he developed a morphine habit six years earlier after being horribly burned during a performance mishap. Sparks had been staying at the Butler House for about a week with his daughter after failing to free himself of his addiction at the Keeley Institute in Dwight, Ill. His death made The New York Times. The Butler House also served as the stage for some wild scenes, more than a few involving fisticuffs, knives, firearms, or, on at least one occasion, a hefty chunk of lumber. In April 1916, two “obstreperous” amateur boxers, John “Chick” Hayes and Jimmie Gardner, caused a ruckus in the Butler House parlor until they met their match in Capt. (later known as “Major”) E.C. Butler, one of Press and Lizzie’s sons. Wielding a “sap,” Butler knocked one of the pugilists across a chair, and the two troublemakers spent the night in jail, charged with drunkenness and disorderly conduct. Press Butler died on Jan. 28, 1918 at the age of 79. The following fall, Lizzie Butler and her son Major E.C. Butler and his family, all of whom had been living at the hotel / boarding house, moved into an apartment building on North Main Street. They then “rented out” the family business, and in its final years the Butler House became known as the Butler Hotel. After the move, Lizzie Butler lived a few months more before passing away on Feb. 8, 1920. “Her life was characterized by kindness,” eulogized The Pantagraph. “Few women have been so universally loved and her death has thrown a pall of sadness over the wide circle of friendship, which had spread around her during her long residence in the heart of the city.” An executor’s sale was held three weeks later, but the bids were deemed too low, so the family decided it best to raze the three-story wood-frame hotel and sell the lot. The four-story brick addition was left standing. The “historic hostelry” then came down in the summer of 1922, the framing dismantled and carted off for reuse elsewhere. “The hotel is the oldest in the city and is one of the noted landmarks in this section of the country,” reflected The Pantagraph. A filling station later replaced the Butler House corner, as the periphery of downtown became the increasing domain of businesses serving the automobile—from service garages to dealer showrooms. The brick addition facing Madison Street remained standing into the 1950s, and the faded letters spelling “Butler House” could be read on its north wall for many years. During the Great Depression the building served as a shelter for the homeless and then became Sheeney’s Tavern. Between 1956 and 1961, this building and the remaining ones on the southern half of the block bounded Madison, Front, Roosevelt, and Washington streets were razed. Today, the Butler House lot is an underutilized eyesore; one more surface parking lot in a downtown blighted by them. The Butler name survives into our denuded present because the city-owned space is called the Major Butler Lot, the “Major” part apparently a nod to either one or both of Press and Elizabeth Butler’s sons. William Butler served as a major in the Spanish-American War, and his brother Edward as a captain, though later on Edward became known as “Major” Butler as well, though whether he officially attained that rank is unknown.",

    "content": "Regarded as one of the greatest pound-for-pound boxers of his era, world bantamweight champion Harry Forbes lived and trained in Bloomington for a stretch of his title defense and several years afterward. In a professional career that began in 1897, Forbes was known for his fluid footwork, deft parrying and coolness under pressure, as well as having a smartly tactical and strategic approach to the “sweet science.” Early boxing records are notoriously incomplete and inexact, and various sources provide conflicting—sometimes wildly conflicting—lifetime records for Forbes and his fellow late 19th and early 20th century “glovemen.” One of the more definitive boxing sources credits Forbes with 86 wins (45 by knockout), 17 losses and 26 no decisions. Born in Rockford, Ill. in 1879, Forbes’ parents hoped that their son would become a classically trained violinist, but young Harry had other plans—to say the least! “The kids of the neighborhood in which Forbes lived gave a boxing show nearly every Saturday afternoon and Harry soon proved to be one of the star performers,” noted a 1911 profile in the Chicago Tribune. Such exploits “brought down the wrath of the Forbes household on his head.” One morning, for instance, Harry found his new pair of boxing gloves burnt to a crisp in the kitchen stove, courtesy of his mother. “To this day they are opposed to it,” the Tribune said of the parents and the sport of boxing, “and although Harry has occupied the prominent place of champion they are not proud of the career he chose.” Fighting primarily at the bantamweight class of 115 to 118 pounds (the term bantam comes from bantam roosters), Forbes faced many elite practitioners of the “fistic arts,” including “Terrible” Terry McGovern; “Torpedo” Billy Murphy; Charley Goldman, who would go on to train the great heavyweight Rocky Marciano; Benny Yanger, “The Tipton Slasher;” Billy “Turkey Point” Smith, the model for Thomas Eakins’ wondrous painting “Salutat;” Matty McCue, “The Belle City Bomber;” and, most famously, the incomparable Abe Attell, a featherweight champion known as “The Little Hebrew.” On Nov. 11 1901, Forbes captured the world bantamweight title with a second round knockout of Danny Dougherty at the West End Athletic Club in St. Louis. Forbes not only lived and trained in Bloomington in the early 1900s, he also fought in the city on several occasions. For several decades, local boxing fans spoke in reverent tones of the epic 20-rounder between Forbes and Walter “The Fighting Jew” Bloom. Staged at the old east side fairgrounds, which once encompassed an area bounded today by Country Club Place, Mercer and Oakland avenues, and Vale Street, the Independence Day 1900 match was sponsored by the Merchants’ Athletic Association. Forbes was ruled the victor on points. Near the end of his title defense run, Forbes made his home in Bloomington. While here he was closely associated with James C. “Doc” Carroll, one of the more colorful characters in Twin City history. Described at the time of his death as “prince of sportsmen, bon vivant [and] all around good fellow,” Carroll spent his whole life in Bloomington. Slight-of-build, he first earned a name for himself as a jockey, though in the 1890s his sporting life was put on hold while he spent two years in the state prison in Joliet for burglary. “Doc” (who was decidedly not a physician) was a Bloomington saloonkeeper for two some decades, operating an establishment on the 200 block of West Washington Street with William Radbourn, brother of National Baseball Hall of Fame hurler Charles “Old Hoss” Radbourn. In 1914, Carroll opened a billiards hall at the same location, decorating the walls with a pair of Forbes’ boxing gloves and other sporting mementoes. It appears that Carroll served as Forbes’ manager or trainer while the fighter lived in Bloomington. “The routine of each day in training is not always the same,” noted The Pantagraph in a lengthy 1903 interview with the bantamweight champ, “but there is a lot of hard work with the pulley weights, dumbbells, vaulting horse, wrestling, sparring with a training partner, etc., and plenty of walking and running.” His workouts often ended with a cold shower or bath, and then a rubdown. During his time in Bloomington, Forbes lived at 811 E. Olive St. (the house is still standing.) The Bloomington city directory lists his occupation as “physical instructor,” a likely euphuism for boxer or professional athlete. Bloomington’s very own bantamweight champion lost his title on Aug. 13, 1903 to Frankie Neil, who knocked him out in the second round at the Mechanics Pavilion in San Francisco. In 1909, Forbes and his brother Clarence were implicated in a spectacular confidence scheme orchestrated by the John C. Mabray gang out of Council Bluff, IA. This group, known as the “Millionaires’ Club, falsely promised to fix boxing matches, among other sporting events. More than 80 members of the gang were indicted and 14 convicted of “extensive swindling and fraudulent use of the mails,” the latter group including Harry Forbes and his brother Clarence, a well-regarded fighter in his own right. The Forbes brothers were sentenced to two years in the Fort Leavenworth federal penitentiary. President William Howard Taft, though, commuted Harry’s sentence and reduced his $10,000 fine, partly for his cooperation with federal officials. Taft, it must be noted, was also a fine boxer in his day and remained a fan of the sport during his White House years. Two years before his conviction, Forbes walked away from boxing, only to reenter the “squared circle” (as the ring is known) in 1910, appearing in more than 20 fights over the next several years. After suffering a second round knockout at the hands of Paddy Meehan in Glen Cove, NY, on Sept, 22, 1913, the former champ retired a second time, though he did return nine years later for a single bout, losing to Jimmy Katz in Chillicothe, OH by points. After hanging up the gloves for good, Forbes settled in Chicago, working various jobs, including boxing trainer and court bailiff. The old fighter died on Dec. 19, 1946, at the Illinois Masonic Hospital (now Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center) at the age of 67. “Four decades ago, pound for pound, he was probably as tough, rugged and as game a scrapper as ever stepped into the ring,” eulogized Pantagraph sports editor Fred Young. “Forbes fought too in an era when the fistic world was jammed with good fighters. But none of them were as clever as Harry, and any old-timer will tell you that there has never been a niftier boy than Forbes.”",

    "content": "You might’ve missed it, but Thursday, Nov. 10, marked the 50th anniversary of the first airing of the Star Trek episode “The Corbomite Maneuver.” Of interest to those of us in Central Illinois is that this episode was written by Gerald Allan “Jerry” Sohl, who prior to that spent 12 years in Bloomington as a feature writer for The Pantagraph. During his time in Bloomington Sohl wrote science fiction short stories and no less than nine novels. He then moved to Southern California and found success in the television industry and Hollywood. He also wrote a wide-range of published fiction, both low and middlebrow, from soft-core paperbacks to mainstream hardcovers. As with many writers, science fiction or otherwise, Sohl cut his teeth in the newspaper trade. It was said he started as an office boy with the Evening American, one of the many long-gone Chicago dailies. His years as an “ink-stained wretch” included stops in Beulah, Mich. with the Benzie Record, and Sycamore, Ill. with the True Republican. Sometime in 1946, after serving in the Army Air Forces during World War II, he came to Bloomington to work for The Pantagraph. Sohl and his wife Jean raised three children during their decade-plus in the Twin Cities. A fine pianist, he became the newspaper’s music editor and critic, and even offered commentary on WJBC Radio. Sohl once defended classical music in an on-air debate with the station’s “After Hours” disc jockey Ollie Henry, who was there to “give out for jazz.” Sohl and fellow “Pantagrapher,” Don Goodrich, also endeared themselves to the community by showing movies to patients at Fairview Sanatorium in Normal. Sohl’s first known published work, the short story “The 7th Order,” appeared in the March 1952 issue of Galaxy Science Fiction, one of the many cheaply printed pulp digests of this type in wide circulation during the postwar years. His first science fiction novel, “The Haploids,” was published around the same time. That was followed in quick measure by “The Transcendent Man” and “Costigan’s Needle” (both 1953), “The Altered Ego” (1954) and “Point Ultimate” (1955). Not surprisingly, at some point Sohl scaled back his Pantagraph duties to part-time work so he could concentrate more on his career in science fiction. His first five novels were published by Rinehart & Co. Although not as prestigious as some New York publishing houses such as Alfred A. Knopf, Rinehart was no fly-by-night outfit, publishing as it did Norman Mailer’s first two novels and Langston Hughes’ memoir “I Wonder as I Wander,” among other titles from prominent writers. Sohl’s 1950s novels have been noted for their “slick surface and sharp economy of scale” turned out by a “professional craftsman.” During his years in Bloomington these works were reprinted (and often translated) by publishers in Argentina, Brazil, France, Italy, Japan and West Germany. In August 1958, Sohl and his family said goodbye to the Twin Cities and relocated to the sunny clime of Southern California, settling in Thousand Oaks, a community well within the orbit of Los Angeles. He began writing for television, with early credits including shows both quickly forgotten and fondly remembered, including “M Squad,” “General Electric Theater,” “Route 66,” “Alfred Hitchcock Presents” and “Target: The Corrupters!” In 1963 and 1964 he ghostwrote three episodes of “The Twilight Zone,” including the perennial fan favorite “Living Doll” (featuring a “Talky Tina” killer doll). For years these episodes were credited exclusively to Charles Beaumont, a beloved fantasy writer closely associated with “The Twilight Zone.” By 1962, though, Beaumont was suffering from the onset of Alzheimer’s and found himself unable to complete scripts. As a result, he relied on friends such as Sohl to write under his name so he could continue paying medical bills and keep his family afloat. Sohl, as noted above, is also associated with the original Star Trek series, the one that aired from 1966 to 1969 and starred William Shatner as Captain Kirk and Leonard Nimoy as Mr. Spock. He’s credited with the script or story idea for three episodes, though one appears under the pseudonym Nathan Butler. “The Corbomite Maneuver,” which aired fifty years ago last week, was just the third Star Trek episode produced for the inaugural season (though due to delays with post-production special effects, it was the tenth to air). In the half-century since then there have been five additional television series and more the 720 episodes of Star Trek. To have your name on the third installment of this sprawling, ever-expanding fictional universe (a seventh series is due early next year) is no small accomplishment! As with many genre writers, Sohl wrote plenty of trashy stuff to pay the bills, all the while employing several byzantine nom de plumes, including Sean Mei Sullivan and the gender-bending Roberta Jean Mountjoy. Sohl’s movie credits include two adaptations in the 1960s of H.P. Lovecraft stories, “Die, Monster, Die” (since renamed the forgettable “Monster of Terror”) and “Curse of the Crimson Altar,” both starring Boris Karloff in the twilight of his career. His wide-ranging oeuvre includes the nonfiction companion volumes “Underhanded Chess” (1973) and “Underhanded Bridge” (1975), cheeky book-length treatises on how to cheat or gain unfair advantage “at the table.” Although pegged as a science fiction and fantasy writer, Sohl also published mainstream fiction. His 1973 novel “The Resurrection of Frank Borchard” from Simon & Shuster, for instance, received a strong notice in The New York Times. Yet his next two books were cheap and kitschy (to put it kindly) dime store paperbacks. From Fawcett Gold Medal came the titillating soft core “Mamelle,” written by Nathan Butler and carrying the tagline, “She was underage and oversexed—a perfect combination.” And then there was Sean Mei Sullivan’s novelization of the Hong Kong martial arts movie “SuperManChu: Master of Kung Fu,” published by Ballantine Books. Jerry Sohl passed away at a Thousand Oaks hospital in 2002. He was 88 years old. Fourteen years before his death, in 1988, he reflected on a career that included forays into the lowbrow. “Oftentimes, you have to write because you absolutely have to have the money, so you do make compromises,” he said. “Then you have people come up to you and say, ‘I really loved that novel. It changed my life.’ I get so much of that and it’s a tremendous feeling of accomplishment. What it comes down to is that it has been great fun and if I should die in the next minute I don’t think I would regret anything I’ve done.”",

    "content": "At the southwest corner of the Courthouse Square, near the intersection of Center and Washington streets, stands a historic marker of brick topped by a bronze plaque. “Center Street site,” it reads. “First brick pavement in the United States / Innovation to Modern Highways / Installed 1877.” Mighty impressive. Unfortunately, the claim of “first” is simply not true. This well-worn myth has been around for nearly a century, if not longer, though as oftentimes is the case with local legends and lore, there is some truth to the story. The plaque correctly states that Napoleon B. Heafer “installed” a stretch of brick pavement in 1877, and it’s mostly correct in that this represented an “innovation to modern highways” (though “streets” would be a more appropriate word choice than “highways.”) In fact, by 1900, the “Bloomington System” of street paving was well-known to city officials and engineers across much of the Midwest. Descriptions of the local method appeared in technical manuals and in the general interest magazine Century. Delegations also visited Bloomington to check out its state-of-the-art pavement. Although Heafer cannot claim the first brick street, he certainly was an early pioneer in the movement. For the record, the first U.S. patent for brick paving dates to 1868, and the nation’s first full block of brick paving in 1873, with Charleston, WV, claiming the honors. It’s difficult for one to exaggerate the transformative nature of brick pavement. Objects left on the streets, even dead animals, would be trampled further into the mud and muck. In the 1850s, one observer identified various items driven into the mud, including a broken lamppost, large barrel, granite blocks, stone jug, window frame and pieces of pig iron. “A continent of mud fathomless and shoreless, they are the terror of strangers and the disgust of her citizens,” was how one visitor to Bloomington described its streets in 1859. “Her streets,” this visitor added of Bloomington, “instead of being an honor and an ornament, are her greatest discredit. With no ready access to building stone, local officials had to look elsewhere. Bloomington’s first paved (albeit non-brick) street was a stretch of East Grove, where layers of crushed rock were laid down in order to facilitate the traffic between downtown and the Illinois Central Railroad depot (located roughly where Beer Nuts stands today.) Gravel was spread on other main thoroughfares and side streets, though heavy rains and traffic quickly created monster potholes known as “duck ponds.” City officials also paved a handful of streets with creosote-soaked wood block, surviving patches of which might still be seen in the drives of a few Grove Street residences. Two years later, 1875, Bloomington brick maker Napoleon Heafer (his middle initial “B” stood for Bonaparte, naturally) received permission from city officials to install a test patch of brick pavement measuring some 120 square feet at the corner of Center and Washington streets. Heafer’s system featured a four-inch layer of coal cinders topped in sand, followed by a layer of common building bricks laid flat, more sand atop that, and then a second layer of bricks, this time set on edge. The test patch was put down in the spring, and that fall the surface bricks were removed and inspected for wear and tear. Although the experiment proved a success (much to the surprise of skeptics) it took another two years for Heafer and his business partner John McGregor to convince the city council to pave the entire one-block stretch of North Center Street running along the west side of the Courthouse Square. This too proved a success, for the street was not repaved until 1892. Once brick paving took off, city officials divided up contracts among three local brick makers, who in turn charged identical price. The quality of Bloomington brick suffered from softness and high porosity, a consequence of low (relatively speaking) kiln temperatures and impurities of the local clay supply. These softer bricks were ill-suited to the punishing grind of 19th century traffic, such as heavy wagon wheels made of iron and steel. In 1896, John Cherry of Jacksonville became the first outsider to receive a pavement contract from the city (see accompanying image.) He also used out-of-town brick, and soon enough Bloomington manufacturers found they could not compete with machine-made, ground shale brick baked at high industrial temperatures. “The American shale paver was surely one of the most indestructible objects created in the 19th century; many equal the hardness of high-grade steel and will scratch quartz,” noted William D. Walters, Jr., an emeritus professor in historical geography from Illinois State University who has studied this topic at length. Heafer’s operation and those of his competitors are long gone, but their clay pits survive as the collection of small lakes scattered at the south end of Bloomington. By 1926, Bloomington had more than 46 miles of brick streets, about 7 of asphalt and 6 of concrete. Brick remained the dominant surface into the late 1930s. Over the next several decades, though, many of the city’s brick streets were buried under one or more layers of concrete or asphalt. In 2017, the city approved a master plan to protect its remaining 3.5 miles of brick streets. Another factual error on the Center Street plaque is the claim that the plaque itself is “set in original paving brick.” The bricks are actually shale pavers produced many years after the 1877 experiment! A decade or so ago, vandals chipped away at the mortar and removed several bricks, believing perhaps they were now in possession of a valuable piece of U.S. history. One would like to think the local history gods got a good laugh this sad case of petty thievery.",

    "content": "This July will mark the 80th anniversary of Amelia Earhart’s mysterious disappearance in the Central Pacific while attempting to become the first female pilot to circumnavigate the globe. The internationally renowned “aviatrix” paid a visit to the Twin Cities not once but twice—the last time a little more than a year before her ill-fated flight that ended in one of the greatest mysteries of the 20th century. For her first visit, May 31, 1931, Earhart made an unexpected stopover at the Bloomington Airport, which was then located several miles north of Normal. She had attended the Indianapolis 500 the day before, and was now headed to the Pacific coast. “Her coming was a double sensation for she piloted the first autogiro [or autogyro ] to visit the local field,” noted The Pantagraph at the time. “Cameras clicked” as the celebrity pilot ordered 30 gallons of gasoline for her “queer craft.” Traveling with Earhart was a pilot representing the Willow Grove, Penn,-based Pitcairn-Cierva Autogiro Company. Autogiros feature an engine-powered propeller providing thrust, and an unpowered, helicopter-like rotor providing lift (wind or the aircraft’s own motion then spins the rotor). This was the second visit to the area of a world famous (or soon-to-be world famous) aviator. Four and a half years earlier, in November 1926, Charles Lindbergh, with his airmail plane running low on fuel during a cold and cloudy night, bailed out some 13,000 feet over Central Illinois, landing outside the tiny McLean County community of Covell. Less than six months later, he would complete the first solo, non-stop flight across the Atlantic Ocean. Earhart, born in Atchison, Kan. in 1897, already held a fistful of aviation records by the time she first stopped in Bloomington-Normal. In June 1928, for instance, she became the first woman—albeit accompanied by a pilot and pilot/mechanic—to fly across the Atlantic Ocean. And on May 20, 1932, one year after her initial visit to this area, she made the same oceanic flight, but this time all alone. Earhart’s second Bloomington-area visit, April 6-7, 1936, included an overnight stay at the Illinois Hotel (today known as the Illinois House) on the Courthouse Square. Invited by the Business and Professional Women’s Club, she was here to deliver a talk, “Aviation Adventures,” at the old Bloomington Coliseum. Traveling alone, the 38-year-old aviator was seen pulling up to the hotel in a small blue coupe and honking for the bellboy to take her bags. “She wore no hat on her tousled blond head,” reported The Pantagraph. “Her brown gabardine suit was a three-piece affair, slim and tailored, worn with a brown-and-white polka dot blouse and white collar.” On her jacket lapel was emblem of the Ninety-Nines, an organization of women pilots established in 1929, with Earhart as the first president. The emblem included a tiny propeller that revolved around a pearl. During her spring 1936 visit, there was already much talk about Earhart circumnavigating the globe. “The announcement that I am to make a flight around the world in June is erroneous,” she told The Pantagraph. “I am booked for lectures until May 1st, and one doesn’t plan a world trip in 30 days.” Earhart also noted that the aviation industry was shedding its barnstorming, daredevil reputation to become an increasingly dependable and vital mode of transportation. “Aviation should no longer be regarded as a matter of pilots,” she said, “anymore than railroads are thought of in terms of Casey Jones and the men in the locomotive cabs.” During her talk at the Bloomington Coliseum, Earhart explained how she coped with the inevitable jitters before her many acts of aviation adventurism—such as becoming, in January 1935, the first person to fly solo from Hawaii (Honolulu) to the U.S. mainland (Oakland, Cal.). “I have my own philosophy of worry,” she said. “All worry must be finished two months before an expedition sets off. If the goal is not worth it, give up the plan, but never worry. Hamlet would have made a poor pilot, because he was such a worrier.” “Why do you do such things?” was the most common question asked of Earhart. “There is no reason except my own wish,” she said in answer. “I have no claim to having augmented scientific data, though each successful flight builds more firmly the foundation of faith in aviation which is the goal we all strive for.” The following day, after her Coliseum lecture the night before, she toured the eastside Bloomington Municipal Airport. Opened less than two years earlier, in October 1934, its paved runways were a marked improvement over the soggy turf of the old airport in north Normal. While there she took a ride in “Scoop,” The Pantagraph’s very own airplane. Accompanying Earhart were pilot Davis Merwin, the newspaper’s aviation obsessed publisher, and younger brother Loring (see accompanying photograph). The single-engine Stinson SR-Reliant, with room enough for a pilot and several passengers, was actually The Pantagraph’s fourth generation Scoop (thus its designation as Scoop IV). After this Bloomington visit, Earhart made public appearances in Princeton, Ill., and Macomb before meeting her husband George Palmer Putnam in Chicago. The two were then scheduled to travel to West Lafayette, Ind., where Earhart served as a visiting faculty member of Purdue University’s aviation department. On June 1, 1937, Earhart and crewmember Fred Noonan embarked on a globe-spanning flight in a modified twin-engine Lockheed Electra 10E. On July 2, the two pilots and their plane were lost during an attempt to reach tiny Howland Island in the Central Pacific. They only had about 7,000 miles left of their 29,000-mile journey. No physical evidence of the Earhart, Noonan or the plane has ever been found. During her 1936 lecture in Bloomington, Earhart charmed the audience with her self-deprecating humor. The Pantagraph noted that her talk began with a “lively account of mistaken identity, which makes the famous flyer feel that sometimes she does not know who she is, and who she is not.” Earhart recalled a recent incident in which a man struggled to recognize her. “Try the air,” she said, hoping that clue would jar his memory. “Oh yes,” he exclaimed. “I hear you every week. You’re Gracie Allen!”",

    "content": "Part of baseball’s attraction as the National Pastime is the sport’s inextricable connection to the rhythm of the seasons—how it begins in the springtime when life holds boundless promise, and how it ends in the autumn chill with, more often than not, broken dreams. “It breaks your heart. It is designed to break your heart, ” the late Baseball Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti famously said of the game. Ballplayers, after all, are wistfully known as the “boys of summer” for those same reasons. Yet though mostly forgotten today, when it came to baseball in the late 19th and early 20th century, there were also the “boys of winter.” At the time, “indoor baseball,” which was played during the winter months with a squishy, oversized ball as big as 17 inches round, proved popular in cities and towns across the nation. “Indoor baseball comes in at a time when athletic sports are at a low ebb,” observed The Pantagraph back in late 1901. “Football closes Thanksgiving, and there is but little doing in an athletic way until the baseball season opens up in the spring, unless the time is filled in with the indoor article of ball.” Basketball, let it be noted, was still in its infancy, and would not become a dominant cold-weather sport for a few more decades. The indoor game has its own creation story, though whether it’s an exercise in pure mythmaking along the lines of Abner Doubleday “inventing” baseball in a cow pasture in Cooperstown, NY, this author cannot say! Anyway, the story goes that on Thanksgiving Day 1887, at the Farragut Boat Club on Chicago’s south side, George Hancock and other Ivy League alumni awaiting the results of the annual Harvard-Yale gridiron clash, passed the time by inventing and playing an indoor version of baseball. They did so by taping up a boxing glove and using some sort of stick as a bat. And viola! The game of indoor baseball—also known as playground or “mush” ball—was born. The game quickly spread across the Windy City and beyond. In the late 1800s, Bloomington’s National Guard unit, Company D of the 5th Regiment, fielded the only organized, equipped and competitive local indoor baseball club. It helped that the National Guard armory on the 300 block of South Center Street in the warehouse district offered enough space to play the new winter sport (Many readers will remember when this building collapsed in a cascading shower of bricks in July 2011). On May 10, 1898, during the early days of the Spanish-American War, the 5th’s regiment-wide indoor baseball club faced off against the First Regiment’s “nine” (as teams were often called) at Camp Tanner on the state fairgrounds in Springfield. The 5th Regiment, featuring several Co. D boys from Bloomington, held their own in an 8-8 tie at the fairgrounds’ Machinery Hall. The Bloomington Coliseum, which opened in December 1898, was the city’s premier venue for indoor baseball (see accompanying illustration.) Designed by German-born and Bloomington-based architect Paul O. Moratz, the Coliseum’s framework of arching trusses eliminated the need for columns and rafters, creating a cavernous, armory-like hall with a ceiling nearly 60 feet in height. On Feb. 5, 1902, the Coliseum hosted the indoor baseball “championship of Central Illinois,” a 10-5 victory by the visiting Delavan Stars over the hometown Baldwins. “Several hundred witnessed the exhibition and it was fully as exciting as any game of the outdoor variety,” reported The Pantagraph. “It is safe to say that indoor baseball will be the rage here next season and be largely attended. There is some talk now of organizing a league in this city.” Indeed, Twin City residents put together an indoor baseball league of one sort or another in most years during the early decades of the 20th century. For the 1907-1908 season, for example, the municipal league featured four teams—Company D of the National Guard, the Knights of Columbus, the Olympics and the Turners, the latter representing the well-established German-American athletic and social club. The league’s opening day, Dec. 13, 1907 at the armory, drew 250 spectators, with the Turners putting the hurt on the Knights of Columbus 22-11, followed by an 8-7 Olympics victory over Company D. On March 17, 1908, the Olympics clinched the league title, defeating the Knights of Columbus 10-2 before “500 of the noisiest people in the world” at the Coliseum. Admission for the championship game was 15 cents, or the equivalent of more than $4 in 2018 inflation-adjusted dollars. “The spectators,” stated The Pantagraph, “went out of their way to bring fiendish instruments for making an outlandish clamor.” The cacophony included someone banging on a wash boiler, as well as “hundreds of horns and megaphones.” A howling dog even got into the act. The dedication in June 1908 of the YMCA building at the southeast corner of East and Washington streets in downtown Bloomington gave indoor baseball enthusiasts another local “ball field.” The “Y” featured a large gymnasium with balcony seating and a high enough ceiling to accommodate both amateur circus shows staged by locals and the community of trapeze performers who wintered in the Twin Cities. Indoor baseball remained popular into the Roaring Twenties. In the winter of 1922-1923, the “Knife and Fork” league (games were played over the lunch hour) featured seven indoor baseball teams—the American Legion, Consistory, Knights of Columbus, Knights of Pythias, Lions, Rotary and the Young Men’s Club. Games were played at the YMCA. The “luncheon league” season ran from December to the end of February. On Feb. 27, 1923, the Consistory nine topped Rotary 5-1 to claim the league’s championship pennant. The Consistory’s pitcher, Bloomington attorney Harold Hulse, “was in rare form all evening,” related The Pantagraph, holding Rotary to five hits while issuing only one walk. He also sent eleven batters back to the dugout “for a drink of water” (that is, they struck out!) In the early spring of 1930, the YMCA organized an indoor baseball league with a six-week season. “Indoor baseball has always been popular here and a good list of entries is expected for the loop,” noted The Pantagraph of March 25. By the following season, in January 1931, there were at least five teams in a youth league, including those from Victory Hall, a boy’s home in Normal, and the Western Avenue Community Center. Yet as basketball became the wintertime team sport of choice, the popularity of indoor baseball declined accordingly. Even so, a form of the indoor sport survives today as outdoor 16-inch softball, which remains popular in the Chicagoland area.",

    "content": "On Dec. 5, 1940, two of Bloomington’s favorite sons returned home to call upon Americans to support Great Britain in her greatest hour of need. These were dark days. The U.S. had yet to enter the Second World War, France had fallen six months earlier to the German blitzkrieg, and now the Nazi war machine had turned its attention towards the British Isles, the last redoubt of liberty in Europe. The two former Bloomingtonians, Chicago attorney Adlai E. Stevenson II and Pulitzer Prize-winning foreign correspondent Edgar Ansel Mowrer, appeared together at the Majestic Theater on behalf of the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies. With some 600 local chapters across the nation, this nonpartisan group maintained that dramatically increasing military aid to the United Kingdom was the best way to keep America out of the widening war. Its members supported the “Destroyers-for-Bases” bilateral agreement of September 1940 involving the transfer of 50 WW I-era destroyers to the British in exchange for naval bases in the Caribbean and Newfoundland. And they were enthusiastic champions of the proposed “Lend-Lease” program (eventually approved in the spring of 1941), in which the U.S. transferred arms and supplies to allied nations. Even so, they steadfastly argued that the Franklin Roosevelt administration had to become far more proactive when it came to Great Britain’s defense. The group also opposed a negotiated peace with the Nazis, calling such diplomatic outreach not merely appeasement, but “treason to democracy.” In 1940, Adlai Stevenson, who would go on to become Illinois governor, two-time Democratic presidential candidate and United Nations ambassador, served as chairman of the Chicago chapter of the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies. He certainly had his work cut out for him, as Chicago was the center of “America First” isolationist sentiment. The powerful America First Committee was based in the Windy City, with Gen. Robert E. Wood of Sears-Roebuck serving as chairman. And the Chicago Tribune, under the publisher Robert R. McCormick, was the leading voice for the American First movement in the country. “Firsters” believed the American way of life and its democratic institutions and principles could be saved only by steering well clear of foreign entanglements and another European war. As horrible as the Nazis might be, they argued, they posed no threat to the U.S. mainland. Elizabeth “Buffie” Ives, who shared her brother Adlai Stevenson’s interest in international affairs, played a leading role in establishing a “Defend America” chapter in the Twin Cities. Other local members included Florence Fifer Bohrer, Hazle Buck Ewing, Eugene D. Funk, Clyde Hudelson, G.J. Mecherle, Louis L. Williams and Carl and Julia Scott Vrooman. The local committee sponsored lectures and “patriotic mass meetings.” For instance, an Oct. 22, 1940 gathering at Chenoa High School featured Carl Vrooman and George M. Palmer, an English professor at Illinois State Normal University. On Dec. 5, 1940, the committee welcomed celebrated newspaperman Edgar Mowrer as its keynote speaker for a public forum at the Majestic Theater, an old vaudeville house in downtown Bloomington. Although Adlai Stevenson—given his later rise to national prominence—is the much bigger name today, Mowrer was the main draw back in 1940. Edgar and his older brother Paul Scott Mowrer spent their early years in Bloomington, growing up in a modest residence at 418 E. Grove St. (it’s still there). Stationed in Rome in the early 1920s, Edgar reported on the ascendency of Italian fascism and Benito Mussolini. The Daily News then assigned him to the Berlin bureau where he diligently covered the nightmarish rise of Adolph Hitler and the National Socialist (Nazi) Party. In 1933, he earned his Pulitzer (his brother had picked one up four years earlier) and wrote the bestseller, “Germany Puts the Clock Back.” For his steely-eyed reportage, he was targeted by the Nazis. With his life in serious danger he reluctantly left Germany and relocated to Paris, and from there covered Europe until France’s fall in June 1940. Now, six months later, he was back stateside and in Bloomington, beseeching his countrymen to wake up and squarely face the horrors unfolding overseas. A 40-year-old Stevenson, who in eight years time would be the governor-elect of Illinois, introduced Mowrer to the overflowing Majestic Theater audience, calling him the “sparkplug of the greatest staff of foreign correspondents of an American newspaper.” “Germany wants to rule with a gangster mentality” and establish nothing less than a “United Slaves of Europe,” warned Mowrer. As such, he called for placing the U.S. economy on immediate war footing, with the nation’s industrial workforce beating plowshares into swords “seven days a week and three shifts a day,” all in order to aid the British and keep America out of the war. Mowrer specifically called for the U.S. to dramatically ramp up production of military aircraft, believing, perhaps naively, that it could play a decisive role in ending the war before any American lives were lost. “If we could give Britain mastery of the air so Germany could get what she has been dealing out in the way of devastation from the air,” he said, “the German people might give up their dictator and return to the role of a civilized people.” In his opening remarks introducing Mowrer, Adlai Stevenson recalled how in 1915, during World War I, he and a few of his teenage friends snuck into the Majestic Theater (“this gilded palace of pleasure” he called it) to catch a vaudeville review, including a trick bicyclist and a “bewitching girl in a short ballet skirt and pink tights.” “On that epic evening at the Majestic the world was in flames, but somehow the bicycle rider (or the girl in pink tights!) seemed a lot more important to me than the war,” Stevenson said. “Tonight the world is in flames again and I wish I could feel about it now the way I did then. It would be nice to be complacent in the shadow of an awful catastrophe …to be undisturbed while tyranny engulfs free peoples everywhere; to be light-hearted when we know we can’t escape.”",

    "content": "Strange thought it may seem, in the early, golden days of commercial television there was an ABC affiliate right here in Bloomington. Undercapitalized from the start, small market and small-time WBLN (“BL” for Bloomington and “N” for Normal, naturally) channel 15 never really had a chance. Be that as it may, for a few short years in the 1950s Twin City residents could boast of having their own local television news, as well as an assortment of anything goes live programming, from “Hillbilly Jamboree” to Uncle Ralphie and Randy Riggins.” The station’s founder and first owner was Cecil W. Roberts, a Missouri resident who owned several small radio stations in the Show Me State and Kansas. Roberts first hoped to have WBLN on the air by October 1, 1953. Temporary offices were set-up in the Rogers Hotel in downtown Bloomington until completion of WBLN’s “Television Center” complex near the corner of the Route 66 ‘beltline” (now Veterans Parkway) and Morrissey Drive / Highway 150. The “Center,” such as it was, consisted of a modest one-story concrete block building and a 450 foot broadcast tower (which on a clear day could be seen as far away as Funks Grove). The building also included two garage doors so local car dealers could roll in their showroom beauties for live commercials. Yet construction, labor and equipment troubles led to repeated delays. At long last, on Dec. 6, 1953, WBLN made its on-air debut. The four-and-a half-hours of programming that Sunday evening 66 years ago included local weather and sports, as well as “Repeat Performance,” a 1947 film noir starring Louis Hayward and Joan Leslie. Although station manager Jerrell Henry called the picture quality “pretty good,” many viewers said it was blurry. For their part, two area men who sold and installed televisions called the reception “lousy.” By the following weekend, WBLN was on the air from 7:00 p.m. to 11:00 or 11:30 p.m. Programming included a half-hour of local news, weather and sports at 7:30 and 9:30, as well as a hodgepodge of offerings, including the 1930s serial “Radio Patrol,” professional wrestling and the syndicated TV series “The Range Rider.” WBLN’s reception and picture quality steadily improved (though problems persisted throughout the station’s troubled history), and soon folks as far north as Wenona and as far south as Decatur were picking up its signal. The little station began attracting steady viewers, but advertising revenue was harder to come by. In the spring of 1955, owner Cecil Roberts sold his struggling, perennially cash-strapped station to two Anderson, Ind. men headed by radio station manager Worth S. Rough. The agreement entailed Rough paying Roberts $1 and assuming nearly $200,000 in liabilities. Much like his predecessor, Rough lacked the capital to make needed upgrades and investments to compete against stations in Peoria, Springfield, Decatur and Champaign. On the evening of Feb. 5, 1957, WBLN went off the air after the failure of a main power tube. Three days later, Rough announced the breakdown had brought the station’s precarious finances to a head, forcing him to suspend operations an “indefinite length of time.” Rough then sought to get the station’s fiscal house in order by raising $30,000 through the issuance of stock at $25 a share. At the time of the blackout, the station had a small but loyal viewership, what with programming that included “The Lawrence Welk Show,” the popular western series “Cheyenne,” and “Walt Disney’s Disneyland.” “Many who called us after we went off the air,” Rough told The Pantagraph, “volunteered to make small investments in WBLN to get it back on the air.” But the stock scheme couldn’t keep creditors such as General Electric at bay. At a late August 1957 McLean County courthouse hearing, GE attorney T.R. Schwarz told those gathered that “our people don’t think there’s any future for the station here.” To add insult to injury, he also said the corporate behemoth “ain’t about to take” 13 cents on the dollar to settle its accounts. A debt agreement to GE’s liking was finally reached in October, with a relieved Rough telling The Pantagraph that he felt “like the load’s been lifted.” WBLN returned to the air Dec. 1, 1957, no longer an ABC affiliate but operating as an independent station. The back-on-the-air celebratory telecast included appearances by Bloomington Mayor Robert McGraw and other local dignitaries. The station promised lots of local programming, including twice-a-day newscasts with sports and weather, a weekly panel discussion on the Bible called “Thinking About Life,” a sports roundtable featuring area coaches and athletes and other shows. The station also purchased the “champagne package” from movie distributor National Telefilm Associates, and on most nights it would air two movies, the last one—beloved by local night owls—beginning at 10:30 p.m. Yet the resurrection was short-lived. The station went off the air yet again on Jun. 5, 1958. This time there would be no comeback. The ignoble end came in late November 1960 when WBLN directors agreed to liquidate the remaining assets of the “non-operating” station. Much of this story is covered in Doug Quick’s fascinating book Pictures on the Prairie: The First Ten Years of Mid-Illinois Television, which came out last year. Many will know Quick from his career as a Central Illinois television and radio personality. He’s currently a weathercaster and anchor on WCCU, FOX-Channel 27 out of Champaign. It’s a shame that so little of the early years of small city television—the richness and eccentricity of local programming—survives today. Oh what untold treasures have been lost to time! Take for instance WBLN’s “Hillbilly Jamboree,” which aired for a while on Wednesday evenings from 8:00 to 9:00. An advertisement from early December 1957 promised appearances by “Uncle Johnny Barton, Clara Mae and all the ‘Hillbilly Jamboree’ gang.” The show was sponsored by Clay Dooley tire and auto, Marben’s, a downtown Bloomington men’s clothier, and the Bloomington Livestock Pavilion. Jack Keefe, Bloomington resident and current compiler of The Pantagraph’s popular daily feature “How Time Flies,” remembers as a seven or eight-year-old being a guest on WBLN’s “Uncle Ralphie and Randy Riggins,” a children’s show featuring a ventriloquist act. Randy, Jack tells us, was the dummy.",

    "content": "The Springfield Race Riot of August 14-15, 1908, when thousands of white residents rampaged through the city’s black areas destroying life and property, remains one of the darkest chapters in Illinois history. And Bloomington, although 60 miles to the north, found itself closely tied to the unfolding crisis. On the evening of August 14, a mob numbering 5,000 to 10,000 descended on the Sangamon County Jail fully intending to lynch two African-American men—Joe James, accused of murdering a white man, and George Richardson, wrongly accused of raping a white woman. Fortunately, Sangamon County Sheriff Charles Werner had seen to the temporary transfer of the two accused men beforehand. Harry Loper, a white Springfield restaurant owner, drove the two prisoners and several sheriff deputies to the outskirts of Springfield where they caught a northbound Chicago & Alton Railroad passenger train to Bloomington. Loper lived through the Cincinnati race riot and was not eager to relive the experience. “I didn’t care whether the Negroes were hanged if they were guilty,” he said later, “but I wanted to avoid the bloodshed that would be the result of an attack on the jail.” Once in Bloomington, James and Richardson were held at the McLean County Jail. This was the same jail many longtime area residents will remember. Located at the corner of Madison and Monroe streets on the west end of downtown Bloomington, it was built in 1882. This increasingly cramped and decrepit facility didn’t close until 1977. Back in Springfield, the enraged rabble, unable to get their hands on the two men, turned on the African-American community, rioting through the city’s black commercial district and residential neighborhood. The mob set fire to buildings and lynched two African-American men who had no connection to the alleged crimes. Thousands more white residents came out to watch black homes and businesses burn, and when firefighters attempted to put out the flames the crowd cut their hoses. National Guardsmen from Springfield and elsewhere played a key role in restoring order. The Bloomington-based Co. D, Fifth Regiment, arrived in the state capital the morning after the initial spasm of violence, bolstering the ranks of those already on patrol. The Pantagraph reported a Co. D trooper used his gun to warn off a crowd closing in on a “colored brother” (as the newspaper referred to the African-American man). “In the wrecked and burnt district the soldiers are keeping the people on the move, not even small groups being allowed to congregate,” it was noted. Interest in the Springfield riot was such that The Pantagraph ran a special 3 p.m. edition on August 15. An estimated 2,000 to 3,000 blacks fled Springfield. Conductors on the Illinois Traction System (ITS) interurban coming into Springfield from the north reported the countryside “covered with Negroes, each with a little bundle of belongings.” The refugees, reported The Pantagraph, “seem in the greatest terror and are travelling as rapidly as their baggage will permit.” A fair number of these Springfield evacuees ended up in Bloomington to stay with friends, family or Good Samaritans. Two days after the riot, the Rev. Henry Sallie related his harrowing escape from Springfield to a packed audience at Bloomington’s Mount Pisgah Baptist Church. Sallie, the owner of a bicycle shop and lunch counter, was having supper at home when set upon by the mob. “Seeing that if I stood my ground and tried to protect myself and property I and my friends would be killed outright we jumped out of a rear window and ran for our lives,” he said. “Others of my race in crowds were running from the locality as if fleeing before a tidal wave.” Race relations were tense in Bloomington as well. On Aug. 17, a “miniature riot” broke out on West Market Street at the C&A bridge, where a crowd of whites hurled insults and then rocks at two African-American men until one of them emptied a revolver in the direction of his tormentors. Luckily, no one was killed or wounded in this exchange. In a pointed editorial, The Pantagraph acknowledged that anti-black mob action was not uncommon to the North. “The race feeling is no longer sectional,” it read. “The South has no monopoly of it but it manifests itself in its most violent form in the North as well.” Even more insidious, The Pantagraph noted a telling difference between anti-black violence, North and South. “A southern lynching … does not aim at driving the Negro out so much as intimidating and keeping him down,” noted the editorial. “But the northern mob undertakes to change the character of the population. It aims to the whole Negro race and compels the innocent and the guilty alike to move on. In involves pillage, loot and plunder.” Northern race riots, in other words, were a form of “ethnic cleansing,” though that term was not yet in use. During George Richardson’s stay in the McLean County Jail, The Pantagraph detailed (though thankfully in less than sensationalistic terms) his “checkered career,” which included manslaughter charges and several years in the Joliet penitentiary. A grand jury indicted Richardson on rape charges several days after he arrived in Bloomington, though the simmering “race trouble” back home prevented his swift arraignment. “His return will be delayed,” reported The Pantagraph, “until the mob spirit in the city has been fully allayed.” About one week later, Richardson’s accuser changed her story, swearing to an affidavit that he was not her attacker. Sheriff Werner then released him without ceremony on September 4. “Richardson has been a good prisoner in the jail here and at no time has shown evidence of anxiety,” noted The Pantagraph. “He was smiling and happy and said that he was going to live pretty straight in the future.” For his part, Richardson returned to Springfield, and there he passed away in 1948 at the age of 76. Back in 1908, a few days after Richardson’s release, Sangamon County deputy sheriffs conducted Joe James back to Springfield. He was speedily convicted of murder, and on October 23, hanged in the Sangamon County Jail. This was done despite the fact that James was 18 years old and as a minor not subject to the death penalty. In contrast, of the hundreds of lynch mob participants and arsonists, and the thousands of vandals, looters and co-conspirators, there was but one conviction, and that was for petty larceny. The shock of such mob violence erupting in Abraham Lincoln’s hometown spurred civil rights activists in New York to action. Their subsequent meetings played a pivotal role in the formation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).",

    "content": "“How pleasant it is, immediately after the noontide hour of a hot summer’s day,” mused The Pantagraph in 1857, “to stroll away from the dusty streets of a noisy city, and spend an hour or two in sauntering through a shady park, or in reclining on a soft grassy carpet in the immediate neighborhood of a fountain of clear water.” The “shady park” in question was Bloomington’s Franklin Park—which just so happens to turn a spry 165 years old on Monday. It was the city’s first public “leisure ground”—beating runner-up Miller Park by a full three decades. Located seven blocks northeast of the old county courthouse (now the McLean County Museum of History), some early detractors believed the park was situated too far from the center of town to attract local residents. The park was named for Bloomington Mayor Franklin Price, though why it wasn’t called Price Park remains one of those nagging local mysteries of little consequence. Today, the park stands as one of the lovelier corners of the Twin Cities, but such was not always the case. Sadly, back in the 19th century, it was often a bedraggled sight—little more than a muddy expansive interspersed with neglected trees and weed-choked splotches of grass, with the walkways forever in disrepair. Franklin “Square” (over the years “park” and “square” have been used interchangeably) dates to April 26, 1856, when a trio of prominent residents—Judge David Davis, William Allin and William Flagg—deeded to the city a 591 by 330 foot undeveloped parcel “as a place of public resort, pastime and recreation, for citizens and strangers forever.” The three benefactors placed several conditions on the donation, such as prohibiting the erection of permanent buildings on the grounds. Most importantly, they required the city to “ornament” and maintain the grounds, with failure to do so resulting in the forfeiture of the land back to the donors or their heirs. The city, though, dragged its feet when it came to necessary improvements, thus setting the stage for what would become decades of municipal indifference toward Franklin Park. In late August 1857, The Pantagraph ran an open letter signed “Medicus” urging action before title to the land fell back to the donors. “An ounce of ‘caution’ is worth a pound of cure,” noted the frustrated Medicus. “Does anyone take the hint?” The answer was apparently not, for the situation remained frustratingly unchanged for more than a quarter century. At the August 24, 1883 city council meeting, a petition headed by Judge Davis and signed by more than 100 of the “wealthiest and best citizens” called for renewed attention to the park. The Pantagraph wholeheartedly concurred, noting the grounds had been “shamefully neglected” over the years, and “in many spots the weeds have overpowered the grass, and the trees have become shaggy and broken.” Despite Franklin Park’s often-ragged condition, some of the city’s leading citizens, including Illinois Gov. Joseph Fifer and U.S. Vice President Adlai E. Stevenson I, built or moved into stately residences lining the square. Three of Bloomington’s best-known architects—George Miller, Paul Moratz and Arthur Pillsbury—designed home’s on the square, and members of the Funk family had no less than four homes constructed on its south side. Many of the houses date to the Victorian Era and represent a wide variety of styles, including Italianate, Queen Anne and Georgian Revival. In its early years, the park’s center featured an elaborate 49-foot monument dedicated to the 700 county residents killed in the Civil War. Yet much like the park grounds, the Civil War monument weathered official neglect. In 1898, one of four marble soldiers standing atop octagonal columns broke away and fell to the ground “with a frightful crash.” Twelve years later a second soldier toppled over. Gov. Fifer, a Civil War veteran himself (he campaigned as “Private Joe”), led an effort to raze the unsafe memorial and erect a new one at Miller Park. The lower half of the Franklin Park monument survives today as a relic in the Briarwood neighborhood at the corner of Linden and Emerson streets. Notwithstanding the less-than-manicured grounds—to say nothing of falling marble!—Franklin Park was from its establishment an invaluable public space for recreational, social and political activities, ranging from church picnics to election-season torchlight parades and rallies. In early April 1890, W.L. Evans, one of the three park commissioners, acknowledged the less-than-ideal appearance of the grounds. Evans said that the park “has been left in the rough since it was laid out and now bears the marks of neglect.” He called for $1,000 to $1,500 in long-overdue improvements. One month later, The Pantagraph cheered a $400 city appropriation, most of which was set aside for the laying of brick walkways so one could take a stroll “without destroying the turf.” As it was, the park grounds had become little more than a “sea of mud.” Fortunately, better days lay ahead. Today the park is best known for its mature trees and simple beauty, unadorned as it is without much of the brick-a-brac (such as brightly colored plastic playground equipment) common to newer parks. In 1976 the park and the nearby residences were listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and three years later the neighborhood was designated a local historic district. Franklin Park still retains much if its 19th century character, minus, thankfully, the “sea of mud.”",

    "content": "Someone once said, presumably half in earnest and half in jest, that American contributions to world culture could be reduced to three things: Abraham Lincoln, baseball and jazz. Say what you will about the first two, it’s a lot harder to take third and last one off the list. Jazz has been blessed with innumerable muses, but few if any can match the influence, genius, output and flair of Edward Kennedy “Duke” Ellington, the incomparable pianist, bandleader and composer. Ellington, whose seemingly endless touring schedule was the stuff of legend, made at least nine visits to this stretch of Central Illinois (though there were likely others as well). One of Ellington’s earliest visits—if not the earliest—occurred on Sept. 4, 1931, when his orchestra performed at Mackinaw Dells, a gone-but-not-forgotten resort along the Mackinaw River near Congerville. Ellington was back less than three years later, Aug. 10, 1934, this time appearing at Shalain Park (now known as G.J. Mecherle Memorial State Farm Park) on the southern end of Bloomington. The park’s lovely dance pavilion, which sat on the edge of a small spring-fed lake, was lost in a mysterious fire two years before Ellington’s appearance. That meant that the band played on an outdoor stage with the dance platform spread out before them. Talk about “ Rockin' in Rhythm” in corn country! Tickets were $1 plus tax, though you could catch the whole thing from the east side of the lake for just 40 cents. In the event of rain the performance was to be moved to the city’s old Coliseum, which was located about where U.S. Cellular Coliseum stands today. There was threatening weather that night but it didn’t rain, so it’s likely the outdoor show went on. Interestingly, fellow Cotton Club great Cab Callaway and his orchestra appeared at Shalain Park later that same month. According to Dean Litt, who operated the Coliseum as a roller rink and ballroom for a few years in the 1930s, Ellington and Callaway also performed at his venue. At that time, African Americans were not welcomed at downtown Bloomington hotels or restaurants, so Litt served homemade ham sandwiches to Ellington and his bandmates. On May 15, 1953, Ellington and his 15-piece band were at Illinois State Normal University for a dance at McCormick Gymnasium. Included on stage were Ellington regulars trombonist Juan Tizol and baritone saxophonist Harry Carney. By this time the band traveled by luxury liner bus, making it unnecessary to stay overnight in segregated communities. Ellington was back in the Twin Cities one year later, May 17, 1954, this time performing at the Scottish Rite Temple (now the Bloomington Center for Performing Arts) for the State Farm Employees Activities association. The playlist that night was heavy with Ellingtonia—“Mood Indigo” and “Satin Doll,” for instance—though there were a number of surprises, such as “Happy Go Lucky Loco” and “Jam with Sam.” Those onstage included longtime Ellington collaborators William “Cat” Anderson on trumpet, Paul Gonsalves on saxophone and Jimmy Hamilton on clarinet. By this time young listeners were turning away from jazz, especially the big band sound, and instead falling hard for something called rock & roll. Even so, Ellington would enjoy a return to national prominence with his band’s show-stopping version of “ Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue” at the 1956 Newport Jazz Festival. Although the local audience wasn’t whipped into a near-frenzy as the crowd would be two years later at Newport, the State Farm employees were a surprisingly boisterous lot. At one point the 55-year-old Ellington stepped offstage and repeated several times, “What a wonderful crowd!” Ellington made no less than three appearances in The Pantagraph readership area in 1957: June 11 at the Pontiac Country Club; Sept. 2 at the LeRoy Fall Festival; and Nov. 15, once more at ISNU’s McCormick Gymnasium. Fifteen years later, Sept. 18, 1972, Ellington was back at Bloomington’s Scottish Rite Temple for what was likely his swan song to the area. Introducing Ellington at this concert was Bloomington native Edward Tick, part-owner of longtime local recycler Morris Tick Co. who had served as The Duke’s tour manager during a recent swing through Asia. The 73-year-old Ellington came out in an “impeccable midnight blue suit,” with his straightened hair nearly shoulder-length. Mixed in with the “greatest hits” were more recent and ambitious compositions, such as “Toga Brava Suite” and “ La Plus Belle Africaine. ” “The Duke was on his feet nearly as much as he was at the piano,” observed Pantagraph reporter Dave McClelland. “He would softshoe through some numbers, his arms in perpetual motion. He directed the band with his head, his shoulders, his elbows, and at times even his eyebrows.” At one point during the concert McClelland, who was backstage, overheard a lighting director order more blue light on Ellington. “He’s got all the blue we have,” came the reply. After the show McClelland visited the dressing room and chatted with Ellington, now clad in nothing but boxer shorts and socks. “We’re on the go 52 weeks a year with no holidays,” he said. “You never catch up. You never get to where you want to be.” Ellington, who learned that spring that he was suffering from lung cancer, succumbed to pneumonia on May 24, 1974. Twenty-one years before his death, at the conclusion of the May 15, 1953 show at ISNU, Ellington and his magnificent arranger Billy Strayhorn remained on stage in eerily silent McCormick Gym. With the two of them sitting at the piano they worked at reviving the piece “Is it a Sin?” from the 1920s. “The Duke hummed, Strayhorn corded and the night watchman looked disgusted,” noted Pantagraph reporter Helen Rorabach, observing the impromptu session from afar. Two months later Capital Records released a 45 record with “Bunny Hop Mambo” on the “A side” and “Is it a Sin? (My Loving You)” on the “B.” The two musicians, one of the greatest artistic pairings of the 20th century, American or otherwise, called it a night at 1:30 a.m., finally prodded by their driver who was leaning on the tour bus horn. With due respect to the weary night watchman, in 185-plus years of McLean County history, one would be hard pressed to come up with a more beautiful, more touching and more sublime scene than that of Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn revising an old tune past midnight in an empty McCormick Gym.",

    "content": "The Ashley House, Bloomington’s largest hotel from the Civil War until its fiery end in 1900, had a tumultuous history replete with financial shenanigans, legal entanglements and even the requisite sex scandal. Located at northwest corner of Center and Jefferson streets on the Courthouse Square, the brick, four-story building had an L-shaped footprint that allowed for long hallways and windows in each room. Construction of the Italianate-style hotel began sometime before the Civil War (though the exact year is unknown), and according to one account, shaky finances led Alexander B. Shaffer to abandon his project around 1857. Thomas Ashley, Sr. then bought the liens on the unfinished hotel (which was little more than a brick shell) and saw to its completion in 1860 or thereabout. For much of its history, Ashley and / or his son Thomas, Jr. owned the property and building, all the while leasing the hotel to a revolving door of partnerships and managers. Such an arrangement—to say nothing of the prickliness of Ashley père and fils — lent itself to instability, and it seemed as if the hotel was forever in the process of being remodeled, refurnished and reopened. Yet during intermittent stretches of calm, the Ashley was known as “one of the largest and best kept houses in the state.” The guest register from December 16, 1870, included 68 overnight visitors, with hometowns ranging from Heyworth to New York City. The Ashley also housed varied business concerns over the years. Back in the mid-1870s, an ex-Bloomington cop ran a “restaurant and drinking room” from a basement corner. At this rough establishment, patrons carried in their own beer, and for a “small compensation” were given use of glasses, tables and chairs. At the same time, the Ashley staged gastronomically outlandish meals for Bloomington’s well-off set. For example, the menu for a July 30, 1876, event featured more than 100 items, including mutton broth; boiled beef tongue; spring lamb with mint sauce; chicken fricassee “a la Parisienne;” pickled tripe, breaded and fried in butter; veal kidneys in sauce piquante ; peach fritters with rum; boiled onions in cream; and whortleberry pie. But when it came to the Ashley House, it seemed as if the late-night dinner parties and dances eventually gave way to bankruptcies and courtroom squabbles. In early 1877, proprietors H.B. Cranmer and George Sill sold out to Chicago interests in an unsavory scheme to flee mounting debts. The buyers, a Dr. Clapp and a Dr. Allen, then turned around and handed management of the hotel to J.F. Stafford. Yet by the end of 1877, Stafford & Co. (the “Co.” being the two Chicago doctors) found themselves in a knockdown, drag-out legal battle with Ashley over the lease arrangement. What followed, according to The Pantagraph, was “lawsuit after lawsuit and continual turmoil, bickering and racket.” It wasn’t long before creditors gutted the hotel, taking most everything of Stafford’s, including silverware; mirrors; carpets; mattresses (hair and spring); stoves; and even the chamber crockery. change could not save the structure from a spectacular end. Befitting its turbulent past, the hotel was lost in the Great Fire of June 19-20, 1900, which destroyed a half-dozen blocks or so of downtown Bloomington. Eyewitness Chester Williams recalled looters scrambling out of the burning Windsor with whiskey bottles “jammed in all their pockets and three or four in each hand, with the necks laced between their fingers.” From the ashes arose the far more stable (managerially and financially speaking) Illinois Hotel, which still stands today, though it’s now primarily an office building and known as the Illinois House.",

    "content": "Dr. Edwin M. Colburn, an early Bloomington physician, recalled the popularity of marbles and other games in the early 1840s. Not among children, mind you. No, he was talking about elected officials. “I saw, day after day,” Colburn related in a reminiscence from 1883, “the sheriff, county clerk and other officers in the streets playing marbles and pitching quoits” (the latter was similar to horseshoes, only played with metal rings). Marbles, or at least small spherical objects made to be knocked around with the flick of a thumb or finger, have been around since time immemorial. To cite several representative examples, marbles have turned up in excavations at ancient Mesopotamian and Egyptian sites, and references to them appear in Roman literature. This amusing diversion was all the rage among Bloomington’s adults in the 1850s, recalled one old-timer in 1879. “Boston ring and long taw were the favorite games, and the public streets were often filled with the young businessmen of the city, with coats off, engaged in playing marbles with as much enjoyment and interest as if selling calico and molasses at a good profit.” The 100 block of East Front Street (where Rosie’s Pub is today) was said to be the “great resort for the marble players of early Bloomington.” “Many of the best players are now among the oldest and most esteemed citizens of the city,” added the old-timer in 1879, looking back a quarter century. Indeed, if his recollection is to be believed, Bloomington’s accomplished marble players of the pre-Civil War era included David Davis, Asahel Gridley, Dr. G.W. Stipp, Leonard Swett, Allen Withers and others. There are several accounts of Abraham Lincoln playing marbles, both as a young man and then as an attorney on the Eighth Judicial Circuit. In New Salem, Lincoln boarded with cooper Henry Onstot. T.G. Onstot, Henry’s son, knew Lincoln well. “My first knowledge of him was as a great marble player,” he recalled in a 1902 reminiscence. “He kept us small boys running in all directions gathering up the marbles he would scatter.” Ivory Pike recalled an older Lincoln playing marbles in Bloomington. Pike’s uncle Meshach owned the Pike House on the corner of Center and Monroe streets, a hotel the future sixteenth president frequented. “It was just like Lincoln to stop on his way to the courtroom and play marbles with a group of boys,” Pike remembered back in 1931, at the age of 86. “He was a good mixer and seldom forgot a face. It was easy for him to become acquainted with anyone.” Abe Williams, born in Bloomington in 1870, penned a richly detailed reminiscence when he was 80 years old titled “Up through Boyville in the Old Home Town.” His family home at 1409 N. Main St. was “Boyville headquarters,” he recalled. Their yard included a “fine place in the shade for pitching horseshoes and playing marbles, either ‘little ring,’ ‘bull ring,’ or ‘pat,’ the three common marble games.” It’s been said that a good definition of the game of marbles is “any game played with marbles.” In the 19th century there were hundreds of different games, and hundreds of variations of each game, as “house rules” altered from region to region, city to city, and even neighborhood to neighborhood. Marbles were tolerated by local officials, as evidenced by the fact that one of the more popular venues for the amusement was the county courthouse basement! One such game held on Feb. 13, 1879, drew the attention of the local press. John Wesley VanShoick, age 40, wagered and lost a bushel of peanuts to local tailor William Nightwine, who was 59 years old at the time. As one would expect, tempers sometimes flared. On Mar. 17, 1879, while playing marbles in the courthouse basement, Charlie Smith hit fellow player Tommy Halligan in the head with a nice-sized chunk of coal cinder. “Young Halligan’s wounds were dressed by janitor Newell and at last accounts he was doing well,” reported The Pantagraph. For boys, railroad tracks were a popular spot to play marbles, as the hard, compact surface between the rails and ties proved an ideal “pitch” to stage everything from a fleeting game to an all-day tournament. Marbles were a big sport in the warehouse district south of downtown Bloomington. “Complaint is made that the boys congregate on the Big Four and Lake Erie tracks near Lee Street to play marbles,” reported the Mar. 28, 1895 Pantagraph. “No objection is made to the marbles, but [the boys] become so interested in their games that they become oblivious to oncoming trains, and they are in continual danger of being run over.” Asphalt streets were also a popular surface for marbles, though this too posed dangers. In February 1912, area motorists complained that boys were playing marbles smack in the middle of busy streets, unmindful of approaching traffic. Boys played marbles mostly outdoors, so the first games were often as good a sign of approaching spring as the robin. When cement sidewalks began appearing in the early 1900s, they became a popular place to shoot marbles. Even so, boys still gravitated to railroad tracks, if for no other reason than to be far from the watchful eye of parents and other meddlesome adults. In mid-March 1917, a group of small boys were spotted playing marbles on the Illinois Central tracks in Normal (this line is now Constitution Trail). “It is true that some games have been played upon the concrete walks about town, but these are not the real signs of spring,” observed The Pantagraph. “They are merely sporadic cases, but when the boys congregate upon the right of way and play ‘keeps’ with pewees, glassies and agates (three types of marbles), it’s a sure sign that spring is here.” For many older men, marbles were a part of childhood they could never quite let go. “There is many a man who even today, should you visit him, will lead you to his den,” reflected the March 26, 1918 Pantagraph, “and there, in his archives which have become his holy of holies because they contain the mementoes of a happy, youthful existence, he will proudly exhibit a chest filled with marbles of all descriptions.”",

    "content": "On April 10, 1860, five-and-a-half weeks before accepting the Republican nomination for president, Abraham Lincoln was in Bloomington to deliver an address on the burning issue of the day—slavery and its expansion westward. This would prove to be Lincoln’s last major speech in a city where he spent so much time, both in the courtroom as a lawyer and on the speaker’s platform as leader of the newly formed Republican Party. The speech is also of interest because it was the only significant one by Lincoln during a crucial stretch in his political career. Over a two-month period, from the second week of March, when he wrapped up two weeks of stumping through New England (this after his historic address at New York City’s Cooper Union), all the way through his May 18 nomination in Chicago, Lincoln made only one major address—and that was in Bloomington! Exhausted from his early spring 1860 New England tour, Lincoln returned to Springfield and concentrated on his law practice, all the while turning down most speaking invitations. One exception, though, was a request from his Republican friends and colleagues in Bloomington. Lincoln used his April 10 speech in Bloomington (he was in town for the spring session of the McLean County Circuit Court) to address popular sovereignty and how that principle—cherished by Democrats and despised by Republicans—related to both slavery and, strangely enough, Mormon polygamy. Lincoln delivered the speech at Phoenix Hall, which was located on the south side of the courthouse square. Opened in October 1858, the assembly room measured a cozy 43x105 feet, spanning as it did the upper floors of two of the five buildings that comprised the Phoenix block. (In 1917, Livingston’s department store razed five of these Greek Revival-style buildings—including the two housing Phoenix Hall—to make way for a modern department store. Today, Michael’s Restaurant occupies the street-level floor of that building.) The only detailed record of Lincoln’s April 10, 1860 speech appeared in the April 13 edition of the Illinois Statesman, a Bloomington newspaper affiliated with the Democratic Party. The Statesman was a lively competitor to The Pantagraph, itself aligned with Lincoln and the Republican cause of halting the expansion of slavery in the western territories. In spite of the vitriolic partisanship commonplace in the antebellum press, the Statesman’s account of Lincoln’s April 10 speech was—all things considered—both fair and (shall we say) balanced. Its version of the speech was then reprinted in the April 17 Illinois State Register, Springfield’s influential Democratic paper. According to the Bloomington Statesman, Lincoln pointed to the supposed hypocrisy of the Democrats wishing to exercise federal power in the territories over one issue (Mormon polygamy) while steadfastly embracing a hand’s off approach over another (slavery.) Since passage of the 1854 Kansas-Nebraska Act, Democrats, led by Sen. Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois, had championed “popular sovereignty,” the idea that settlers—and not the federal government—had the right to either allow or disallow slavery in newly organized territories. Douglas embraced popular sovereignty as the American beau ideal of self-government in action. Lincoln, in sharp contrast, found the doctrine odious because it placed both supposed political freedom and slavery on the equal moral footing. In a speech in Bloomington back in Sept. 1854, Lincoln declared that if popular sovereignty expanded slavery’s reach, it was decidedly not an expression of “self-government,” but rather one of “despotism.” Six years later, again in Bloomington, Lincoln argued that when it came to polygamy, many Democrats ignored their beloved principle of popular sovereignty in a mad dash to squash the practice of plural marriage. For instance, just days before Lincoln’s speech, the U.S. House—with support of many Democrats—passed a bill criminalizing polygamy. Lincoln further argued that even a milder anti-Mormon measure put forward by Congressman John A. McClernand, another Illinois Democrat, tossed aside any real concern for popular sovereignty. He noted that McClernand “proposed to suppress the evil of polygamy” by splintering the Utah Territory and having adjacent (and thus non-Mormon majority) territories absorb its constituent parts. The Statesman, though editorially at variance with Lincoln’s views, nonetheless noted his bemusement over the Democratic Party’s dilemma. McClernand, a devotee to Douglas and popular sovereignty, could not support direct congressional action to end polygamy, so he instead crafted the backdoor political maneuver of territorial dissolution to accomplish the same. “This inconsistency, Mr. Lincoln illustrated by a classic example of a similar inconsistency,” the Statesman noted. “‘If I cannot rightfully murder a man, I may tie him to the tail of a kicking horse, and let him kick the man to death!’” Lincoln believed he had the Democrats cornered. “Why is not an act of dividing the Territory as much against popular sovereignty as one for prohibiting polygamy?” he asked. “If you can put down polygamy in that way, why may you not thus put down slavery?” For its part, The Pantagraph admitted to not having “the time to write, or the space to insert, a synopsis of the speech.” The city’s Republican paper, though, did remark on size of the crowd. “Notwithstanding the rain and the mud, last night” it reported, “Phoenix Hall was full to its capacity of attentive listeners to the speech of Mr. Lincoln.”",

    "content": "Beginning in the 1960s, many fine, sturdy single-family homes dating from the 19th and early 20th centuries were unceremoniously bulldozed for Illinois State University off-campus housing. The greatest loss in this destructive—and at times unchecked—pattern was the 1856-1857 Jesse W. Fell house, located at 502 South Fell Avenue. Born into a Pennsylvania Quaker family, Fell was 24 years old when he came to Central Illinois in 1832. He was the first lawyer in the new county seat of Bloomington, though he gave up a legal career in favor of land speculation and town development. He played an instrumental role in the establishment of the state’s first public institution of higher education (now Illinois State University), and is considered the founder of not only the Town of Normal, but a half-dozen other communities, including Clinton and El Paso in Central Illinois and Larchwood in the northwestern corner of Iowa. In 1859, Fell cajoled his friend and political ally Abraham Lincoln to pen an autobiographical sketch in order to improve his name recognition and boost his prospects for the 1860 Republican nomination for president. Fell built his two-story, wood frame Federal-style house to serve as the centerpiece of a triangle-size, fifteen-acre parcel of landscaped grounds bordered on the north by the Chicago & Alton Railroad (today Union Pacific and Amtrak), east by Broadway Avenue and south by Vernon Avenue. If one overlaid the estate on today’s reconfigured street layout, the house would’ve originally occupied an area south of Irving Street (which didn’t exist in Fell’s day) and west of Broadway Avenue. The house was situated on high ground just southwest of the junction of the Illinois Central Railroad (today Constitution Trail) and the C&A. When Normal was first platted in 1854 it was known as North Bloomington or simply “The Junction.” The design of the house is credited to Fell. Around the same time, Edwin C. Bakewell built a similar Italianate residence to the northwest. Later known as the Gregory House, it’s is a well-known local landmark today on the 600 block of North Main Street, north of University High School Fell called his home and surrounding acreage “Greenwood,” though area residents (who were welcome to stroll the property on Sunday) preferred “Fell Park.” The attractive grounds were credited to William Saunders, a Scottish-born landscape designer from Philadelphia whose work included the Soldiers’ National Cemetery at Gettysburg, Penn. Perhaps the best account of Greenwood comes from a detailed reminiscence of the place by Fell granddaughter Harriet Fyffe Richardson. “Around two sides of the property ran a picket fence painted red,” she recalled. “The southeast corner, occupying what would be the equivalent to a city block, was a deer park surrounded by an elaborate high picket fence, also painted red.” A “pretty little steep-roofed house or chalet” in the northwest corner offered shelter for the four or five deer Fell kept on the grounds. The avenue running from the south gate to the house was lined with arbor vitae, and the grounds included apple, pear and peach trees; “quite extensive vineyards” of Concord, sweet Delaware, Catawba and other grape varieties; currant and gooseberry bushes; a “very large” strawberry patch; and two cows to provide butter and cream for the household. Outbuildings included a carriage barn and a playhouse for children. Lincoln was said to be an occasional visitor to Greenwood, spending nights in a large room on the second floor. According to Harriet Richardson, other visitors included Owen Lovejoy, the abolitionist-turned-congressman, educator Horace Mann and poet William Cullen Bryant. After financial reverses, Fell foreclosed on Greenwood and moved two blocks south to 702 South Broadway, and there he passed away in 1887 (that house still stands). After his death the old Greenwood grounds were platted into streets and residential lots, while the house was moved several hundred yards west along the 500 block of South Fell Avenue, where it remained until its untimely demise. F.W. Dooley and his wife Laura Rhodes purchased the house in December 1913, making drastic changes to both the interior and exterior, including the removal of the cupola and a Fell-era 1½-story addition. The east and west side verandas were pulled off at a later date, giving the once-elegant structure a boxy, stripped-down look. The last owner was Cushman Skinner, whose grandmother Lucile Heckethorn had earlier held the house for some thirty years. Skinner rented the historic but deteriorating place to ISU students, though by the mid-1970s he decided to leave it vacant after several kids skipped town, saddling him with unpaid rent and utility bills. Around this same time, Kevin and Pamela Kennedy, a local couple with an interest in preservation, had the house placed on the National Register of Historic Places. It had previously appeared on the Historic American Buildings Survey of 1936 and the Illinois Historic Landmark Survey of the early 1970s, though both designations, like the National Register one, did not prevent the owner from tearing it down. There were several proposals to save the house, but Skinner, for reasons unknown, seemed uninterested in any and all preservationist efforts. A group of prominent local residents, including the Rev. William Hammitt, ISU President Lloyd Watkins and Fell descendent Timothy Ives, held several meetings with Skinner’s attorney, but the two parties never reached a deal. With little fanfare, the house came down in mid-August 1980. “Grooves and ruts from the tracks of heavy equipment are all that mark the lot,” noted The Pantagraph a week after a bulldozer completed its job. Today, a nondescript student apartment complex stands in its place. One would be hard pressed to come up with a more painful preservation loss in all of Normal’s rich history.",

    "content": "Born, raised and educated in Central Illinois, Christian educator Minnie Vautrin was an eyewitness to one of the most horrific and cruel tragedies of the 20th century—the Nanjing Massacre of 1937-38. As Japanese soldiers laid waste to the Chinese city of Nanjing (formerly Nanking), killing and raping tens of thousands of civilians, Vautrin protected an untold number of women and children, and by doing so became known as the “Goddess of Mercy.” Wilhelmina “Minnie” Vautrin was born in 1886 in Secor, a Woodford County community situated between El Paso and Eureka. A gifted student, she attended Illinois State Normal University, and though her studies were interrupted several times due to the need to work, she graduated in 1907. For the next three years, Vautrin taught mathematics at LeRoy High School. From there she headed to the University of Illinois, earning a bachelor of arts. Yet to the surprise of her friends, she decided to embark on a career as a Christian missionary, and was sent to China through the Foreign Christian Missionary Society and the help of LeRoy Christian (Disciples of Christ) Church. Vautrin would then dedicate her life to China, only returning to the U.S. for extended “furloughs” to continue her graduate studies. After her first six years in China, for instance, she came back to earn a master’s degree in education at Columbia University in New York City. During her extended stays stateside, Vautrin often came home to Central Illinois to visit friends and speak at churches and to various groups in Bloomington and elsewhere. When she returned to China after the first furlough, she settled in Nanjing, a major city in eastern China on the Yangtze River. There she taught at Jinling (now Ginling) College, founded in 1913 as the first school to offer bachelor’s degrees to women in China. For her part, Vautrin didn’t view her missionary work in China through a paternalistic or patronizing lens. She exhibited a deep respect for the Chinese people and their culture, and concentrated her efforts more on the education of girls and young women than saving Christian souls. She also found fault with U.S. foreign policy. “It is very difficult for western diplomats to forget their investments, their profits and their business interests when they are dealing with a weak and comparatively helpless nation,” she observed in a 1927 letter to friend Maude Cline of LeRoy. “I wonder how much big business and the dictation of businessmen is determining our present policy in Mexico, China and the Philippines. We would probably be shocked if we knew, and the church of the West would be surprised.” Vautrin well understood the driving force behind Chinese foreign policy. “China feels that she must not be controlled by western nations thru unequal treaties and concessions; she feels that she must have a self-respecting place in the family of nations,” added Vautrin in her 1927 letter. The Nanjing Massacre, also known as the Rape of Nanjing, occurred during the Second Sino-Japanese War, a prelude of sorts to the global conflict a few years away. With the Japanese Imperial Army marching toward the city, Vautrin, who was then serving as Jinling College’s acting president, helped orchestrate the evacuation of faculty and students. She remained behind, though, to keep watch on the school grounds. Japanese troops entered the mostly undefended city in December 1937. The worst of the looting, burning, raping, brutalizing and killing lasted six weeks, leading to the deaths of upwards of 300,000 Chinese soldiers and civilians. A group of foreigners in Nanjing, led by German businessman John Rabe and including Vautrin, organized the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone in city’s Western quarter. This “safety zone”—the borders of which were marked by Red Cross flags—offered some measure of safety for thousands upon thousands of Chinese civilians fleeing the charnel house of the fear-soaked and blood-drenched city. Although Japanese soldiers generally left foreigners unmolested, that didn’t stop them from raiding the safety zone to wantonly rape and kill. “Last night up to 1,000 women and girls are said to have been raped, about 100 girls at Ginling College … alone,” John Rabe recorded in his diary on Dec. 17, 1937. “You hear nothing but rape. If husbands or brothers intervene, they’re shot.” Vautrin spent much of her time racing from one corner of the school grounds to another to halt incursions by Japanese soldiers. She was armed with nothing more than a letter from the Japanese embassy ensuring the protection of those within the safety zone. “Some soldiers were fierce and unreasonable and most of them had their bayonets out ready for use and on not a few of them I could see fresh blood stains,” noted Vautrin. At one point, the number of civilians seeking refuge on the Jinling College campus grew to an estimated 10,000. “I personally feel that I cannot leave,” Vautrin wrote in her diary. “Men are not asked to leave their ships when they are in danger and women are not asked to leave their children.” Once a semblance of normalcy returned to Nanjing, a physically exhausted and mentally shaken Vautrin headed back to the U.S. Secor residents prepared to welcome their town’s favorite daughter with a “Minnie Vautrin Day,” but organizers had to postpone the county-wide reception when she suffered a nervous breakdown. One can only imagine the demons tormenting a traumatized Vautrin. “The constant scene that seems to run through her mind,” her physicians noted at the time, “is that she brought it on herself because of certain alleged mistakes that she thought she had made.” A 54-year-old Minnie Vautrin took her own life on May 14, 1941. For her efforts protecting civilians, the Chinese government posthumously awarded Vautrin the Emblem of the Blue Jade. Today, Jinling (now Ginling) Women’s College is part of Nanjing Normal University. Nanjing itself is a city of more than 8.2 million residents, a commercial and cultural hub of eastern China with one of the largest inland ports in the world. Vautrin is remembered with memorials in the Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall and on the Ginling campus. Her story has been kept alive in the U.S. as well. She figures prominently in “The Rape of Nanking,” a 1997 best seller written by American journalist Iris Chang. In 2002, Roanoke Boy Scout Troop 71 erected a memorial in the front of the Secor Community Center. And the University of Illinois Press published “Terror in Minnie Vautrin’s Nanjing,” a collection of her diary entries and correspondence from 1937-38 edited by scholar Suping Lu. William Furry, Illinois State Historical Society executive director, has expressed interest in the erection of an official state historical marker in Secor commemorating Vautrin’s life and legacy, though such a project is dependent on local participation and financial support. “Had I ten perfect lives,” Vautrin recorded in her journal not long before taking her own life, “I would give them all to China.”",

    "content": "As part of a Memorial Day observance last month, active and retired Twin City firefighters placed flags on the graves of former members of the Bloomington and Normal fire departments. This annual rite, now organized by Bob Wills, a retired Bloomington firefighter and vice president of the Bloomington and Normal Association of Retired Firefighters, has become even more meaningful as a concerted research effort in the past several years has greatly increased the number of documented gravesites. So far, Wills and others have expanded the number of located graves from 75 to 232. Evergreen Memorial Cemetery is the final resting place for 90 identified Bloomington and Normal firefighters. There are also 75 such gravesites at Park Hill; 33 at East Lawn Memorial Gardens; 27 at St. Mary’s; 5 at St. Joseph’s; and 2 at Holy Cross Cemetery in Normal. The Memorial Day weekend tradition takes on special significance when it comes to firefighters who died in the line of duty. In the history of the Bloomington Fire Department, eight members and one volunteer made the ultimate sacrifice, either combating a fire or from injuries sustained at the scene of one. The department’s first fatality occurred in 1912. On March 7 of that year, Maurice Luby died of a heart attack while carrying a ladder during a house fire on the 1400 block of North Morris Avenue on the city’s west side. The 47-year-old had been a Bloomington firefighter for 22 years, making him one of the longer serving members of the department at the time. Luby’s funeral was held at Holy Trinity Catholic Church and he was laid to rest at St. Mary’s Cemetery on the city’s far west side. “The sacrifices incident to the life of a fireman for public safety and for public welfare are as worthy the crowning laurel as are those of any who give up their life for their country’s good,” noted The Daily Bulletin, a Bloomington newspaper, of Luby’s death. “Sorrow-stricken” firemen flanked a stretch of West Washington Street as the funeral cortege headed to St. Mary’s Cemetery. The fire department’s full complement of horses, wagons, and ancillary equipment—“with which the dead fireman was so familiar”—also lined the street, “while a fire gong toiled a doleful requiem.” Engine House No. 5, Luby’s last assignment, was draped in black for the week. On Jan. 15, 1922, Lawrence F. “Larry” Burns suffered a fatal fall fighting a fire from the roof of Wayman African Methodist Episcopal Church. “Burns had only fairly got a hold on the hose when it filled with water and jerked backward,” reported The Bulletin. “His feet slipped on the ice-coated roof and he was hurled from his position.” Falling to the ground head first, he sustained a fractured skull and was taken to Mennonite Hospital, where he died a few days later. Funeral services were held on Jan. 20 at Holy Trinity. The Rev. C. H. Medcalf led the requiem mass and delivered the funeral sermon. Medcalf made special note of Burns profession. “To labor is to pray,” he said. “And in this manner,” added The Bulletin, “Larry Burns had lived a prayerful life.” May 7, 1928 remains the darkest day in the Bloomington Fire Department’s long and storied history. On that night, a 40 foot wall of the burning, multistory J.E. Will & Co. furniture store collapsed, burying more than a half-dozen firemen in a shower of bricks, timbers and other debris. Two were killed on site, and five more injured, including the father of one of the dead firefighters who himself never recovered and died three weeks later. Despite the wall collapse and missing comrades, firefighters continued to battle the blaze, successfully containing it to the Will & Co. building, which was located on the 500 block of North Main Street, the longtime “furniture row” of the Twin Cities. One fireman, Charles “Gunboat” Smith, was pulled alive from the debris two hours after the wall gave way. Yet as rescue efforts continued through the night and into the next morning, and as volunteers from the Chicago and Alton Railroad Shops and elsewhere pitched in to speed up recovery efforts, hope of finding the two missing firefighters alive slowly gave way to despair. Walfried Moline’s lifeless body was found the following afternoon astride a fire hose. “He had evidently died with the nozzle in his hands,” noted The Pantagraph. The 31-year-old had been with the department for 3½ years. It was almost two full days after the fire that Louis Payton’s remains were freed from the ruins. The 29-year-old Payton was a volunteer, though he was posthumously made an honorary firefighter by the city. His father, Frank Payton, hospitalized with a leg broken at the hip, among other injuries, died nearly three weeks later, on May 29. Thankfully, the Bloomington Fire Department has not lost another firefighter in the line of duty since the J.E. Will & Co. fire 91 years ago. Bloomington firefighter Rich Batka, whose research greatly added to the number of firefighters honored with flags on Memorial Day weekend, also wrote the recently published, profusely illustrated coffee table book, “Bloomington Fire Department: Highlights of the Department’s History from 1855 to 2018.” With the July 4th holiday this week, Miller Park will be packed with picnickers and thousands of folks hoping for clear skies and a rousing fireworks show. It’s a fitting day as well to visit the Bloomington firefighters’ memorial on the park’s north end. It features the bell from the first fire station, and a life-size bronze statue of a present-day firefighter, saddled with heavy gear. This detailed, evocative work by Bloomington artist Andrew Jumonville was unveiled last October during Fire Prevention Week. “His bravery was equal to that of the soldier who fell in battle, and he is as deserving of our respect and gratitude,” eulogized Rev. Medcalf back in 1922 on the life and career of Bloomington firefighter Larry Burns. “We should appreciate to a greater extent the invaluable services rendered us by our public servants, the firemen and the police.”",

    "content": "Sixty-six years ago this week—Thanksgiving Day, Nov. 26, 1953—a disappointingly small crowd was on hand to watch the last Corn Bowl in Bloomington. What’s that you say? Never heard of the Corn Bowl? Well, that’s not surprising, as it’s one of many long-gone, small-time holiday bowl games scattered across college football’s storied past. Between 1947 and 1953, there were six Corn Bowl games held in Bloomington. Local organizers believed hosting a Thanksgiving Day college football game would prove a boon to local businesses, as well as a smart public relations move for the community as a whole. In the lead up to the inaugural Corn Bowl, the game’s then-general chairman, A.B. Perry, envisioned the erection of a 150,000-seat football stadium to host the annual Turkey Day tussle. And since the bowl game enjoyed the sponsorship of hybrid corn breeders--including Pfister and Funk Bros. Seed Co.—Perry also thought the stadium could be used for agricultural fairs and exhibitions. Suffice to say, no colossal Corn Bowl was ever built in the Twin Cities or elsewhere (today, the largest sports venue in the U.S. is Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor, with an official capacity of 107,600.) Perry’s exuberant vision notwithstanding, the first Corn Bowl—Southern Illinois University’s 21-0 victory over North Central College of Naperville—was held at Bloomington High School’s Fred Carlton Field, a far cry from any bowl or college stadium of any respectable size. An estimated 5,500 spectators braved the wet snow and cold drizzle typical to many Central Illinois Thanksgivings. Although the game fell far short of big-time bowl expectations, the pre-game, Thanksgiving morning Corn Bowl parade was an unqualified success. Some 30,000 folks lined the streets of downtown Bloomington to catch sight of 90-plus floats and seven bands in what The Pantagraph called “the longest and best parade ever held in Bloomington.” For the 1948 Corn Bowl the following year, some 8,400 spectators watched Illinois Wesleyan University beat Eastern Illinois State College (now EIU) 6-0. The second game in the series was the first to be played at IWU’s own football field (now known as Tucci Stadium). Never again would Corn Bowl organizers sell as many tickets as they did in 1948. In the end, the bowl could not overcome the twin obstacles of late-November Midwestern weather and the lack big-time football programs and their promise of drawing power and gate receipts. The first and fourth games in the series were played in snow and ice; the third in a cold rain; and the fifth in snow and bitter cold. And IWU and EIU—though both schools boast rich football traditions and histories—have never challenged the likes of UCLA or Notre Dame when it comes to national name recognition. After a one-year hiatus, the Corn Bowl returned in 1953 for what would prove to be the sixth and final such game held in Bloomington. Community wide enthusiasm for the bowl game had cooled considerably since its inception and early expectations. The 1953 Corn Bowl, for instance, did not include a parade. And the previous game, in 1951, included a weighty 50-plus page program. There would be no such souvenir tome for the 1953 contest. For much of the bowl’s history, the American Legion Louis E. Davis Post 56 of Bloomington served as the principal sponsor. The game doubled as a fundraiser for the post, with the proceeds from ticket sales in 1953 going to the American Legion’s junior baseball program. For the 1953 Corn Bowl, the 25-member organizing committee paired Iowa Wesleyan College in Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, against Western Illinois State Teachers College in Macomb (now WIU.) The Tigers of Iowa Wesleyan, champions of the Iowa Intercollegiate Athletic Association, claimed a roster with players from nearly a dozen states, with the Illinois contingent including at least ten Chicagoans. Western Illinois finished the Interstate Intercollegiate Athletic Conference in second place, trailing only Central Michigan College of Education (now Central Michigan University.) Let it be said that the Corn Bowl was not the only such game overshadowed by the giants of the holiday bowl season, such as the Orange (Miami, Fla.), Sugar (New Orleans) and Rose (Pasadena, Cal.) bowls. In 1953, for instance, there was the Refrigerator Bowl in Evansville, Ind., featuring Sam Houston State and the College of Idaho, while the Olive Bowl in Lindsay, Cal., pitted—pun intended!—La Verne College against the College of the Sequoias. Once more, chilly weather and snow depressed Corn Bowl attendance. The 2,500 spectators for the 1953 Corn Bowl represented a “fair-sized crowd,” noted one clearly charitable observer. The snow arrived around halftime, and it continued to fall through the entire second half. “The weatherman apparently has a curse on the Thanksgiving Day classic,” grumbled The Pantagraph. Snow or no snow, the Leathernecks captured the sixth Corn Bowl title with dominating offensive and defensive lines—winning the “war in the trenches” as it’s said in the parlance of the game. “Leathernecks chew up Iowans,” was the headline for Pantagraph sports editor Fred Young’s post-game analysis. Young credited defensive ends Ray Pearson of Moline and Willie Grant of Hot Springs, Ark. for keeping Tigers quarterback Dick Schmitt on the run for most of the contest. The overmatched Iowa Wesleyan offense managed only 46 yards on 6 of 22 passing, and 80 yards on the ground during a frustrating afternoon that included only 5 first downs. “The boys ‘up front,’” declared Young of linemen, “are always the deciding factor.” Meanwhile, speedy senior halfback Mike Reynolds of Spring Valley—all 5 ft. 7 inches and 175 pounds of him—reached the Tigers end zone four times. His first touchdown came on a 10-yard pass from QB Ted Mullen; the next two from runs of 18 and 21 yards, and the last on a 55-yard punt return. It was an easy call for the eleven newspaper writers and “radio men” in the press box and along the sidelines to pick Reynolds as the game’s most valuable player, and as such recipient of the Sigmund Sorg MVP trophy (named for a Bloomington jeweler and bowl sponsor.) After the game, the Louis Davis Post hosted a banquet at the McBarnes Memorial Building on East Grove Street in downtown Bloomington, with players and coaching staffs from both schools feted with a turkey dinner. After another one-year hiatus, the Corn Bowl returned for a seventh time in what would prove to be its last hurrah. The relocated Thanksgiving Day game was held in Macomb, as the hometown Leathernecks fell to Luther College of Decorah, Ia. by a score of 24-20.",

    "content": "Clara Brian spent 25 years traveling to every corner of the McLean County countryside with the goal of improving the lives of rural homemakers and their families. Her career as McLean County’s first Home Bureau adviser, a role that involved preaching the secular gospel of practical education, science and modernization to farm folk, encompassed two world wars, a prolonged slump in the farm economy and the Great Depression. This remarkable story is one of many told in the newly opened McLean County Museum of History exhibit, “Farming in the Great Corn Belt.” Brian’s work with farm wives—extolling the virtues of everything from indoor plumbing to up-to-date canning methods and bookkeeping—was far from a traditionalist nod to patriarchy. Rather, as a home economist she sought to uplift the role of homemakers and instill pride in their vital work. The intent was to make women not passive actors in the male-dominated Corn Belt but “change agents” on behalf of modernity and reform. The interrelated fields of home economics, sociology and social work emerged from the Progressive Era’s embrace of idealism and optimism, and the belief that the application of scientific principles and emerging technological methods could improve both home life and the greater community. Progressive home economists like Brian championed labor-saving devices for their ability to lighten the suffocating workload of farm women and free up time for uplift, whether of the spiritual, moral, or artistic kind. Raised in Grayville, a community in southeastern Illinois, Brian spent her young adult years in San Jose, Ill. With the death of her mother she kept the family together, and with her sister she ran a millinery shop and then published a weekly newspaper, the San Jose Journal. Brian attended Illinois Wesleyan University in her thirties, graduating in 1915 with a degree in home economics. She then headed to Salina, Kan. to establish a home economics department at Kansas Wesleyan University. All the while, over several summers, she worked toward a master’s degree in dietetics and nutrition from Columbia University in New York City, completing her degree in the summer of 1919. County Home Bureaus were part of a wider movement that began in the 1910s to put into the hands of farmers and farm families the practical information found in the mountain of scientific reports and research pouring forth from land grant universities. As county adviser, Brian would travel to township-based Home Bureau clubs known as “units” and demonstrate how the latest findings and programs at the University of Illinois could be applied to the everyday world of Corn Belt farms—from ivy tower to barnyard, one might say. The McLean County Home Improvement Association (as early Home Bureaus were known) owes its origin to local food conversation efforts during World War I. Brian began her work as county adviser in June 1918, and in her early meetings she educated rural homemakers on wartime rationing of kitchen staples. Topics of her earliest demonstrations included “wheatless bread,” “meatless dinners” and “sugarless desserts.” As the largest county in the state, area-wise, McLean County posed its own challenges. There were thirty townships within the 1,186 square miles of the county, with some 43,000 of the county’s 68,000 residents living outside the Bloomington-Normal area. The township units eventually settled on a schedule of holding one all-day meeting each month, with the adviser spending half that day with the unit. When possible, Brian reached the township units by steam rail or the interurban, but more often than not she had to travel by automobile. The Home Bureau’s first vehicle, a 1918 Ford roadster, was courtesy of a Rotary Club donation. Brian didn’t know how to drive, but after a one-hour lesson behind the wheel she was ready roll! One of the many things we take for granted today is the ease of auto travel in the Corn Belt countryside. There was nothing easy about it during Brian’s early years as county adviser. Of the more than 2,000 miles of road in McLean County at the time, only around 125 miles were paved and 350 graveled. That meant there were 1,500 miles of dirt road, with much of that reduced to impassable muddy quagmires after heavy rains or snow melt. Over an eleven month period beginning June 1918, Brian totaled 4,654 miles crisscrossing the county, 1,300 by rail and the remaining 3,354 in the Ford roadster. She served as home adviser until retirement in 1945, though in the 1920s she took a two-year leave of absence to attend the University of Minnesota on a fellowship to study child development and training. Brian structured her programs within a framework of five general areas of study: food conservation and consumption; health and sanitation; accounting; household “equipment” and management; and textiles. The Home Bureau philosophy was education through demonstration and display, and advisers were sometimes known as “home demonstration agents.” For a textile class on window treatments, for instance, Brian made use of an ingenious miniature window frame to show how to measure and hang draperies and curtains. Never without her folding 3 x 4 camera, she employed photography to illustrate her many lessons and programs to township units. She would make lantern slides from her photographs and project them at unit meetings—images of well-ordered kitchens; ramshackle, unsanitary outdoor privies; canning equipment; tidy chicken yards; and the like—each one a mini-lesson unto itself. Photographs of children, on the other hand, were often meant to convey the primary “reason why” improvements or reforms were needed in the first place. During the past several decades there has been an increasing appreciation of Brian’s photographs, offering as they do a window into a lost world of the Corn Belt on the cusp of full-blown mechanization. There is also a gracefulness, an unromanticized beauty to these often stark and earthy images that tells us Clara Brian had a deep empathy and love for her subjects. One of her more popular program involved home accounting. Based on a University of Illinois-designed system, recordkeeping classes empowered women to better manage their household budgets. Participants would then submit their books to the state for review, receiving in return a written report of their work and some helpful number crunching. Clara Brian passed away on July 10, 1970, at the age of 93. “Her death reminds us,” noted The Pantagraph at the time, “that not all of the important pioneering in McLean County was limited to the 19th century.” The Home Bureau survives today as the University of Illinois Extension. Brian left to the McLean County Museum of History some 500 of her photographic negatives. More than 100 of her photos then appeared in the Museum’s 1989 publication, Places of Pride: The Work and Photography of Clara R. Brian. Sets of her photographs are exhibited from time to time through the Illinois Arts Council, and of late she’s earned recognition through the Illinois Women Artists Project, a 21st century effort that celebrates painters, sculptors and photographers who worked in Illinois from 1818 to 1980.",

    "content": "Death came for John W. Puett on the afternoon of Jan. 12, 1917. The Bloomington grain dealer was at his Twin Grove elevator, located some five miles west of the city along the parallel rail lines of the Illinois Traction System and Big Four Railroad, just south of Old Peoria Road. According Park Enlow, who was the only other person at the elevator, Puett’s overcoat caught the exposed shafting from the flywheel of the engine powering the elevator. With the flywheel moving at around 150 revolutions per minute, John Puett never had a chance. Occupied elsewhere, Enlow heard a sickening thud and “looked and saw the unfortunate man as he was being whirled through space,” reported The Pantagraph. “Mr. Enlow rushed over and stopped the engine, but before the wheel had stopped some of Mr. Puett’s clothing gave away and he fell to the floor.” Puett’s right arm was pulled from the socket, mangled and crushed; his left arm lacerated, and his head horribly beaten about. The right side of his chest was crushed. Enlow telephoned for help, and twenty minutes later Bloomington Drs. A.E. Behrendt and J.P. Noble reached the scene by auto. Behrendt then brought Puett back on the 2:50 p.m. Illinois Traction interurban, and once in Bloomington he was taken by ambulance to St. Joseph’s Hospital (then located on South Morris Avenue on the city’s west side). Puett’s wife, Meda Ray Puett, was spending the afternoon at the Bob Jones revival, held at a temporary wooden tabernacle erected downtown. A search was undertaken to find her, and after being spotted by Chief of Police John J. Jones, Meda was rushed to the hospital, where she had time enough to say her goodbyes. John Puett passed away at 4:45 p.m., 2 hours and 50 minutes after the accident. This tragic story was dutifully recounted in the pages of the next day’s Pantagraph. But daily journalism can only do so much when it comes to giving voice or agency to the grieving loved ones left behind. With Puett’s death, The Pantagraph tells us what happened and to whom, and where it happened and when, but what’s missing, of course, is a deeper window into the human condition, and our world of suffering, love and faith. As a not-for-profit institution, the McLean County Museum of History depends on donations of objects and papers to help preserve the stories of our community’s past. This summer, the museum was contacted by a Stillwater, Okla. resident, who had come into possession of a letter written by Meda Puett to several of her cousins. In this 640-word letter, dated Jan. 26, 1917—two weeks after her husband’s death—Puett struggles with the immensity of her loss. How does one, after all, express the inexpressible? This letter was discovered tucked inside an old book that the donor’s brother-in-law had bought from a bookseller in southern Oklahoma. How it ended up there remains a mystery. Upon receipt of the donated letter, the museum set about to have it transcribed, which was done by museum volunteer JoAnna Mink. The original letter will then be cataloged and placed in the museum’s climate-controlled archives, where it will be available to genealogists, students, and others for generations to come. And as the museum learns more of the Puett story, items may be added to the file. “Dear Cousins: I have thought of you people so much since this terrible sorrow came into our home but haven't been so I could write,” begins Meda’s letter. “I hope you people wont feel bad at me for not sending a telegram at the time for I was in such a dazed condition I really couldn't think of your town.” As Puett relates, she was at the Bob Jones revival, which was in its third week in Bloomington. Jones, the namesake of the university in South Carolina, won fame first on the revival circuit and then with the new mass medium of radio. “I was called away from meeting at the tabernacle to the hospital and in less than half an hour John was dead. He knew me but that was all and couldn't talk but very little … Oh folks you don't know how heart broken I am and from little Russell was the worst brokenhearted child you ever saw. Little did we think when John left us at noon that would be our last dinner together.” Meda Ray and John Pruett were both born in Colfax, and that’s where they married in 1905. They had two children at the time of the tragedy, Geraldine, age 11, and Russell, age 9. The family lived in Bloomington. “I have only pleasant memories to think of, he was so good to me,” Meda wrote of her husband. “I am glad he was such a good man and I believe he is in a better world than this.” The letter speaks to the mysteries of grief and faith—and how they are inexorably entwined. “We had been attending the Bob Jones meeting at the tabernacle and John was so helped by them, and some of the songs were so wonderful, it would have been a hard heart not to be stirred,” Meda told her cousins. “And I'm so glad John knew the right way for how soon he was hurled into Eternity.” “I'm sure if God had not come with comfort to my poor soul I never could have stood it,” she added. Puett’s death also meant attending to his personal and financial affairs. “I have been appointed administratrix and I have my heart, hands & brains full,” Meda wrote. “I am trying to run the elevator and get that big bin of oats off hand. But we are having such a time getting [rail] cars … About all I can do it is to trust to Providence that I'll come out all right.” She did manage the sell the elevator, for that summer it was reopened and in new hands. “Farmers are glad to know that some one has charge of the Twin Grove elevator,” reported the Aug. 11, 1917 Pantagraph. “as it takes two or four teams more [of horses] to haul grain to distant elevators.” By 1930, Meda Ray Puett had remarried, and she and her husband George Charles Garlock, along with her two children, a son-in-law and a boarder were living at the former Puett home on South Main Street. Meda passed away in 1944 at the age of 65. She was living in Joliet at the time.",

    "content": "In 1971, C.E. “Bud” Wink and Dr. Lee Garber of Fairbury undertook an investigation of five-acre Weston Cemetery, located in nearby Yates Township, McLean County. The local newspaper, The Fairbury Blade, then published an article based on their findings. Wink and Garber’s interest in the old cemetery, though, was not about who was buried there, but rather what was growing there. And what was growing there was an astonishing variety of prairie grasses and flowers, many rare and native to Illinois. Weston Cemetery, it turned out, was mostly virgin prairie, the last remnant of any size known in all McLean County. The Prairie State is a nickname that speaks to a lost world, one never to return. Prior to Euro-American settlement, tallgrass prairie covered some 22 million acres of Illinois. In McLean County alone, prairie accounted for almost 670,000 acres, or nearly 90 percent of the county. By the early 1970s, the five or fewer acres at Weston Cemetery, located roughly halfway between Chenoa and Fairbury on U.S. Route 24, was pretty much all that was left—the rest having been mostly plowed under for row crops and pastureland. Today, the Grand Prairie is lost under a seemingly endless checkerboard of genetically modified corn and soybean fields, and the concrete and asphalt sprawl of communities such as Bloomington-Normal and Champaign-Urbana. Of those 22 million acres of prairie statewide, it’s estimated that only 2,300 acres remain, or about one-hundredth of 1 percent. And of those surviving acres, about 50 can be found in 29 pioneer burial grounds, many scatted in central and east-central Illinois. Similar to Weston, parts or all of these cemeteries were never plowed, and though many were mowed once or twice a year for decades, the prairie survived, waiting patiently for the day it would be brought back to its former tallgrass glory. Back in 1971, Robert Betz, a professor of biology from Northeastern Illinois State College (now Northeastern Illinois University), got wind of the article on Weston Cemetery in the Fairbury Blade. Intrigued, Betz traveled to northern McLean County to take a look, bringing along colleague Dr. Herbert Lamp. Since the 1960s, Betz had been crisscrossing the state, on the lookout for patches of pre-settlement vegetation, especially in pioneer cemeteries. “From the character of the soil and the quality of the vegetation, it appears to be in near-virgin condition and should be preserved at all costs,” Betz wrote in a July 6 letter to Dr. Garber of Fairbury. A cursory survey by Betz and Lamp turned up 47 prairie plants, though the naturalist added that “further study will reveal many more species.” Betz was also a consultant with the Illinois Nature Preserves Commission, and so got the ball rolling to designate, and thus protect, Weston Cemetery as a state nature preserve. From there, things moved quickly, especially with the assistance of Dale Birkenholz, Illinois State University professor of biology. On April 11, 1972, Weston Cemetery received protective status as renamed Weston Cemetery Prairie Nature Preserve. Such designation brought long-overdue changes. For instance, mowing and “tidying up” the grounds, except immediately around existing graves, were no longer permitted. And a schedule of controlled biennial burns was instituted to return the prairie ecosystem to its natural rhythms and fecundity. That said, the nature preserve designation did not void the rights of persons to use existing plots for burial purposes, so the nature preserve remained a cemetery, and has maintained dual status ever since. Prairie remnants not only serve as sanctuaries for native plants and animals, but as seed banks for the future, and as such have been likened to botanical “arks.” They also stand as models for future prairie restoration efforts. “Weston is a special place,” says Angelo Capparella, associate professor of zoology in the School of Biological Sciences at ISU. “No restored prairie has ever reached the quality of a true remnant for various ecological reasons. So these serve as an invaluable model for where we are trying to get to with restoration.” At first, ISU’s Department of Biological Sciences served as the environmental custodian of the prairie cemetery. ParkLands Foundation now assumes that vital role. Today, Weston Cemetery Prairie Nature Preserve stands at 5.24 acres, with irreplaceable prairie remnant covering 3.83 acres of that total. According to a recent count by botanist Roger Anderson, distinguished professor emeritus, ISU, Weston Cemetery contains 71 native prairie plant species, as well as 47 introduced plants. The latter category, notes Anderson, includes “agriculture weeds, introduced species like sweet clover, species planted on graves and species associated with disturbed areas.” Depending on the season, visitors to Weston Cemetery Prairie will encounter a wondrous array of native plants, many rarely seen these days, let alone in their natural setting. Prairie flowers on the site include four species of aster (sky blue, heath, smooth and hairy); three types of sunflowers (sawtooth, false and prairie); four goldenrods (tall, grass-leaved, early and rigid); dog bane; cream wild indigo; false toadflax; prairie shooting star, downy gentian; spiked lobelia; violet wood sorrel; false dragonhead; common mountain mint; and many others. Prairie grasses found at the cemetery include big and little blue stem, yellow star, blue-eyed and prairie dropseed. There are no trails at the cemetery prairie, so visitors are encouraged to tread lightly. Large groups are discouraged, and visitors are prohibited from collecting plants or seeds. The community of Weston was laid out in 1867. It served—as still does today—as a grain siding for the Toledo, Peoria and Western Railway (running east-west, TP&W serves as the northern border of Weston Cemetery Prairie). A year or two after Weston’s founding, four local men of some prominence organized the Weston Cemetery Company, and in 1869 or 1870, they purchased five acres east of Weston for a burial ground (although the deed was not recorded until 1884). The fact that Weston never grew to the size of its neighbors, Chenoa and Fairbury, likely saved the cemetery’s prairie remnant. “Of late years no one has given any attention, with the result that it has been overgrown with weeds, and few burials have been made there,” reported The Fairbury Blade in September 1914 on neglected Weston Cemetery. For the past 73 years, the cemetery has been the responsibility of Yates Township. The most complete records on Weston Cemetery are found at the Lexington Genealogical and Historical Society (one of the great resources for local and family history in Central Illinois, by the way!) According to available records, more than 80 people have been laid to rest at the cemetery, with the earliest known burial believed to be 1870 or 1871, and the latest in 1955 or 1956, though most of the burials occurred between 1880 and 1915. As with any cemetery, each burial tells a story. On December 4, 1900, three-year-old Iva “Pearl” Adams burned to death when her clothes caught fire as she and her twin sister played with matches in their family home in Weston. She was interred at Weston Cemetery two days later, on December 6. “In the great gloom there is a radiant hope that the never-dying soul of this sweet little girl is with the angels of God,” remarked The Fairbury Blade at the time. One can hope that the splendor of the native prairie grasses and flowers above her earthly remains offers solace—and a sense of peace—to both those in the sweet hereafter and those still here, among the living.",

    "content": "“Be careful or you'll end up at the poor farm” was a popular admonition well in the mid-20th century. From the early 1860s until the 1950s, the McLean County Poor Farm, located about five miles south of downtown Bloomington, was home to many misfortunate souls. Those welcomed to the Farm, according to an early account, included the “infirm, the aged, the sick, the idiotic, the insane, and those who may be temporarily, through accident or misfortune, thrown upon the common charity.” In 1859-1860, the McLean County Board of Supervisors purchased 220 acres from John Grove Myers and established the county’s first permanent poor farm. Additions were made in 1888 (80 acres) and 1904 (62 acres). The buildings, which eventually included a superintendent’s house, residential quarters, washhouse, stables and various outbuildings, were situated on a 20-acre site just west of U.S. Route 51. In December 1864, there were 32 “inmates” (as the residents were called into the 1940s) at the Farm. The “hopelessly insane and idiotic,” numbering about a half dozen, were kept in unheated cells. “To our mind,” The Pantagraph remarked, “it is sheer brutality and cruelty to keep these unfortunate persons in cold rooms when the thermometer is twenty degrees below zero, but we may be mistaken.” In June 1877, The Pantagraph described the pitiful state of many of Poor Farm’s fifty some residents: Formerly “strong men and women from whom the light of reason has been taken away by its Giver . . . fragments of once prosperous and gleeful families, the wrecks of blasted hopes and ruined lives, young women at whose breasts suckle babes brought unto the world in shame, and young men whom dissipation and sinful practices have brought from the glory of manhood to the level of the most groveling beasts.” The Mclean County Poor Farm, simply put, presented “one of the saddest sights that mortal eyes can view.” For all of its manifold miseries, the Poor Farm was reliably productive for much of its history. In the summer of 1897, for example, there were about 90 acres in corn, 45 in oats and 10 in millet. There were also 90 acres in pasture and a 10-acre truck garden. By 1924 the Poor Farm’s orchard was one of the finest in the county, enabling Callie M. Jones, wife of Superintendent Arthur Jones, to can 700 quarts of peaches. There were also 300 chickens producing a daily average of 200 eggs. In the 1950s, if not earlier, a local sportsmen’s club arranged for the Poor Farm to raise pheasants. When livestock and grain prices were high, such as the First World War, the Poor Farm earned more money for the county than it cost to operate it. Residents performed work if they were willing and able, such as cleaning, tailoring, cooking, canning and field chores. Yet given the age and physical and / or mental condition of many residents, paid staff handled the bulk of day-to-day work. State inspector Anna Hinrichsen visited the Farm in October 1915, issuing a scathing report the following January. In it, she criticized the lack of support staff to care for the 91 residents, 16 of whom were women. “This institution,” Hinrichsen added, “employs the smallest amount of help in proportion to the population of any almshouse in Illinois.” The report noted the peeling exteriors and grimy interiors of the residential buildings. “More attention is given to the domestic animals than to inmates, and they are better housed,” was one typically blunt assessment. Yet ten years later, The Pantagraph called the Poor Farm a “snug haven for human derelicts” and a “model public farm of the United States.” Over the years the Poor Farm was home to profoundly troubled individuals. In 1894, there was the “Electric Man” William Woodard, a former Danvers resident known for his “lectures” on the electrical currents he believed permeated his body. And then there was “John the Baptist,” a resident whose name and personal history were a complete mystery. “He is a religious maniac, but will only talk when spoken to,” noted The Pantagraph. “He is a German but speaks fairly good English.” John the Baptist died in March 1900 having spent most of his final four decades under the care of the county. “They would send all kinds of people out there, old people, drunks, people in trouble of some kind, even prostitutes,” remembered Geneva Smith, wife of Poor Farm foreman Elbert “Pete” Smith. “Sometimes we’d have whole families out there.” The Smiths, interviewed in 1980, worked under Superintendent George Kent, who ran the place from the late 1940s to the early 1950s. In 1953-1954, the county converted the Poor Farm into the Maple Grove Nursing Home. Twenty years later the McLean County Nursing Home in Normal opened and the land comprising the old Poor Farm was put on the auction block. Russell O. Shirk, a founder of Beer Nuts Inc., purchased 320 of the 360 acres, including the collection of buildings. Today, the old Poor Farm site is private property and not open to the public. The Poor Farm was also home to a pauper’s cemetery, or “potter’s field.” The first recorded burials date to spring 1860. The dead were buried in plain caskets in graves often dug by fellow residents. The headstones were plain concrete slabs upon which was inscribed not a name but a number. County residents unable to pay for their burial were also laid to rest at the Poor Farm, as were transients and other assorted nameless, lost, neglected and forgotten souls. The last recorded burial occurred in September 1930 when cemetery became the final resting place for an unidentified newborn found dead at the city dump. The grave marker read “165.” Today the cemetery sits south of the McLean County Animal Control Center, though it’s not accessible to the public. Mused a Pantagraph reporter in 1897: “Here are buried God’s poor—the unfortunates who will be better off in the beyond, where the crooked ways are made straight and the wrongs of this world righted.\"",

    "content": "In the 1960s and into the early 1970s, visitors to the McLean County Courthouse would see two figures stationed at the center of the main floor rotunda—Asahel Gridley and Joseph J. Johnson. Gridley, a key figure in Bloomington’s early history and the city’s first millionaire, had long passed on, his presence represented in bronze, thanks to the efforts of his daughter Mary Gridley Bell. Joe Johnson, on the other hand, was very much alive. Whether it was directing a young couple to small claims court or trading afternoon greetings with the circuit clerk, Johnson was as much a Courthouse fixture as the Gridley statue. “I like to watch the people and to get to know them,” he once said. “For those who don’t know me, I can tell them where to go around here.” (Today, the Courthouse is the McLean County Museum of History and the Gridley statue sits in the north hallway.) Neither county employee nor official greeter, Johnson was simply a retiree trying to keep busy soaking in the hustle-and-bustle of the workaday world. “I’m just meddling, that’s all,” he playfully acknowledged. “He was the best traffic director the Courthouse ever had,” was how his wife Elizabeth put it. Because he seemingly knew everyone, and knew where everything and anything could be found, Johnson was known as “Bloomington’s Human City Directory.” Joe and Elizabeth Johnson lived on the 800 block of East Walnut Street, and because he had no car, he walked the dozen or so blocks to the Courthouse. “I leave home at 11:30 every day, eat my lunch at Kresge’s [a long-gone five-and-dime store on the Courthouse Square], talk to my friends until they have to leave for work, then I come here and direct people until 10 minutes of 4,” he told a Pantagraph reporter from his Courthouse post in 1971. “Even the people at Kresge’s know me. Some of the waitresses call me ‘Uncle Joe.’” Born in 1890 in Union Town, Ala., Johnson was the oldest of eleven children and never got farther than the third grade. His grandparents had been enslaved, and Johnson claimed that one of his great-grandmothers had lived to the age of 118. “I left Mississippi for Memphis, Tenn., but I couldn’t stay there because of the railroad strike,” he recalled. “I tried to get work there and I was offered a job that paid $18 a week. I refused when the boss said that I only had to pay $7 for room and board. I said, ‘Yes, but I also have to buy shoes.’ So I left for St. Louis.” “At the train depot [in St. Louis] a group of us met a man who needed railroad workers,” recalled Johnson. “He told us that he could take us to Bloomington, Illinois, for half fare and that there was no strike. I got a job in the roundhouse until June 1920. At that time we lived in boxcars.” All his life Johnson earned a living with his hands and back, spending his working years as a janitor and laborer for various employers, including the City of Bloomington, Model Laundry, and the Christian Science Church. From 1955 to 1958 he worked at Illinois Wesleyan University, “where there were 1,000 students who didn’t need directing,” he joked. He also did a lot of yard work around town to supplement his earnings. Johnson also enjoyed talking about the old days in Bloomington. “It was just like a village, and it was called the ‘Evergreen City’ then,” he said in 1971. “There were so many trees here, until the elm disease hit them and the city had to cut them down. I can still remember the trees at Wesleyan when I worked there.” Johnson retired in 1958 and three years later began spending part of the day directing Courthouse traffic, becoming something a local legend at the busiest spot, pedestrian-wise, in the entire county. He was a serious churchgoer, and that’s where he met his wife Elizabeth Jackson, the two marrying in 1928. “That’s where you go to get a good husband,” remarked Elizabeth. Like many local African-American women, she found work as a domestic and home laundress. In the mid-1940s, the Johnsons purchased their first home. Joseph was 54 years old at the time, and by saving he and Elizabeth were able to make a down payment of $1,200, fully half the asking price (adjusted for inflation, $1,200 would be the equivalent of more than $17,000 today.) They paid off the remainder in a year’s time, making monthly payments well beyond the minimum. “You’re just like an old clock,” Johnson remembered the creditor telling him, an acknowledgement of the couple’s work and savings ethic, this at a time when most African Americans faced considerable obstacles to social and economic mobility. The Johnsons’ daughter Janice Johnson Moor taught in the Kansas City area, having earned a bachelor’s degree from Illinois State Normal University and a master’s from Kansas State University. By 1975, arthritic knees put an end to the daily downtown excursions, though Johnson, now using a cane, remained active enough to mow his lawn every Monday and tend to a large garden. “I’ve got to get out and get these legs limbered up,” he said at the time. He didn’t head downtown much anymore, and when he did he took a city bus. The end for Johnson came unexpectedly on March 3, 1976. It was a Wednesday afternoon when he flagged down a truck driven by John Holtz, a city water department employee, for a ride downtown. At the corner of Walnut and Elder, the 86-year-old Johnson climbed into Holtz’s cab when, without warning, he experienced some sort of attack. Holtz sped to the fire station, and from there Johnson was taken to St. Joseph’s Hospital, but it was too late. He was pronounced dead on arrival. Upon learning the sad news, Circuit Judge Keith Campbell told a Pantagraph reporter that Johnson’s job was to make those around him feel good. Joseph J. Johnson was laid to rest at Evergreen Memorial Cemetery in Bloomington.",

    "content": "The McLean County Museum of History, as part of its Presidents Day activities on Monday, will have on public display its recently acquired Abraham Lincoln letter. The 160-year-old historically invaluable letter was addressed to Kersey H. Fell of Bloomington, and involved a debt collection case, Fell being a defendant (or debtor) and Lincoln the attorney for the plaintiffs (or creditors.) Kersey’s older brother Jesse W. Fell made a long and lasting imprint on what would become the Twin Cities, playing a central role in getting the state to locate its first public university in Normal, among other accomplishments. In 1836, Kersey followed Jesse to Bloomington, and like his brother, he became an attorney only to leave the law “in favor of the more congenial work of buying and selling land.” Although on opposing sides on this breach of contract case, Abraham Lincoln and Kersey Fell were political allies and acquaintances, what with Lincoln’s extended visits to Bloomington as an attorney on the 8th Judicial Circuit. In fact, he was known to frequent Kersey Fell’s office, located in an upper floor of 106 W. Washington St., a four-story brick Italianate commercial building dating to 1856. That building still stands, and today Burpo’s Boutique occupies the first floor. At some unknown date, likely in the mid-1850s, Kersey Fell and a second individual, identified only as Price, gave Quincy law partners Orville H. Browning and Nehemiah H. Bushnell a promissory note. Upon failure to pay the note, Browning and Bushnell retained Lincoln to sue Price and Fell in an action of “assumpsit” (meaning to recover damages for a breach of contract.) In ruling for Browning and Bushnell, the McLean County Circuit Court awarded $370.82 in damages (or roughly the equivalent of $10,000 today, adjusting for inflation.). The 7½ by 9½ inch fully authenticated letter now in the museum’s collections, dated Nov. 1, 1859 from Springfield, was written after the circuit court ruling and when Lincoln and Fell were negotiating on a payment schedule for the judgment. “My dear Sir,” Lincoln wrote in his unaffected cursive script. “I know not that I shall be at Bloomington soon. I shall be here till Tuesday next; and will be glad to see you.” The letter is signed, “Yours very truly, A. Lincoln.” Brief and businesslike though it may be, this letter wonderfully exemplifies Lincoln’s career as a general practice attorney in litigious antebellum America. In a legal career that spanned nearly a quarter century, he handled more than 2,300 cases involving breach of contract. In fact, debt collection represented about half the caseload of Lincoln’s entire bustling practice. The lack of hard currency, especially in still-developing states such as Illinois, led to the proliferation of promissory notes, which helps explain why debt collection cases were common in Lincoln’s time. These notes, convoluted by their very nature, were often exchanged and renegotiated by a succession of parties. Add to that the era’s boom-and-bust economic cycles of shady development schemes, real estate bubbles and bankruptcies, and it’s no wonder debt-related cases filled the courts. Our understanding of Browning and Bushnell v. Price and Fell is aided by additional letters and court documents, though these are not held by the McLean County Museum of History. “When I went to Bloomington,” Lincoln wrote on Jun. 29, 1857 to his client, fellow attorney Orville H. Browning of Quincy, “I saw Mr. Price and learned from him that this note was a sort of ‘insolvent fix-up’ with his creditors—a fact in his history I have not before learned of.” Much like Lincoln, Browning was a former Whig Party stalwart who joined the anti-slavery Republican Party when it formed out of the latter’s ashes in 1856. Five years later, in 1861, the Republican governor of Illinois appointed Browning to fill the U.S. Senate vacancy left by the death of Stephen A. Douglas. Living in Washington D.C. during the Civil War then, Browning became a frequent visitor to the Lincoln White House. Back in 1859, the court ruled for Browning and Bushnell on Apr. 6. Kersey Fell was unable or unwilling to come up with the full $370.82 judgment, so he put forward a payment plan in a May 20 letter to Lincoln (why Price was apparently no longer party to the judgment is not known.) After waiting more than a month for a response, Fell wrote once more to Lincoln. “I now propose to pay you a part of the judgment—say $150 dollars and the bal[ance] in a year from the date of the judgment,” reads his Jul. 8, 1859 letter. “I would gladly pay it all off now but I can’t do it. Please do let me hear from you in reply and say when you will probably be at home as I want to consult with you about some business matters soon—your friend.” Lincoln replied the following day, accepting Fell’s proposal and ending with this: “Think I will see you at Bloomington in two or three days. If not I will write again. Yours as ever.” The letter the museum now holds is a follow-up to this one of Jul. 9, 1859. Whether Fell paid the judgment in full and on time is not known, though there is no record of subsequent legal action to indicate such. As a not-for-profit historical society, the McLean County Museum of History relies primarily on donations from local residents, groups and businesses for its collections. In the case of the Lincoln letter, retired attorney, Lincoln scholar and museum board member Guy Fraker worked with Sharon Merwin of the Merwin Foundation, which agreed to purchase the letter on behalf of the museum. Guy said the gift is testament to the Merwin family’s continuing commitment to McLean County, and speaks to the legacy of Sharon’s late husband Davis U. Merwin, who was the publisher of The Pantagraph. The museum’s “Presidents Day: The Vote” activities run tomorrow from 12 noon to 3 p.m. at the old courthouse in the heart of historic downtown Bloomington. There will be plenty of fun and educational activities for children of all ages, and a chance to “vote” in a mock election using actual Bloomington Election Commission equipment. In addition, you’ll have the opportunity to visit the Connect Transit Community Bus to meet many of the candidates running for Normal and Bloomington council seats in the upcoming April election. Lincoln’s Nov. 1, 1859 letter to Kersey Fell will be on display in the museum rotunda from 12 noon to 7:00 p.m. When Guy Fraker brought the framed letter to the museum several weeks ago, he parked on the south side of the square at the museum’s main entrance. Guy said that by chance he glanced across Washington Street when getting out of his car, and it occurred to him then and there that 160 years ago this very letter was undoubtedly read by Kersey Fell in his office, which was right across the street! It is rare moments like this when one is privileged to experience the miraculous—if not mystical—melding of the past and present, and history comes alive.",

    "content": "One of the primary missions of the McLean County Museum of History is to acquire objects and papers that speak to the history of the area and its people. As a not-for-profit institution, the museum depends on the generosity of folks like you to help “grow” its collections. Of the museum’s 20,000 objects and 2,000 linear feet of archives, the vast majority of these items and materials have come by way of donation. Last year, The Baby Fold, the Normal-based agency that specializes in the care of at-risk children and youth, reached out to the museum to donate a large collection of its photographs, newsletters, promotional materials, Festival of Trees programs, and other items. Baby Fold staff recognized that they lacked the resources to properly store and care for these historically invaluable materials. In the fall of 2019, the museum, led by Archivist George Perkins, began sorting through the collection. Earlier this year the materials were formally transferred to the museum. An Illinois State University intern, Vincent Carta, then worked to create an item-by-item typed inventory of the wide-ranging collection. Once completed, this inventory, known as a finding aid, will help make the collection more accessible to students and others interested in looking at it. The museum is one of a small number of county historical societies accredited through American Alliance of Museums, and as such not only professionally catalogs donated items, but also stores them in secure, climate-controlled rooms to ensure their long-term preservation. Included in The Baby Fold donation was a 20 by 30 inch architectural rendering, dated Nov. 6, 1948, of a proposed—but never-realized—six-building campus at the corner of Linden and Willow streets in Normal (see attached partial views of the larger rendering.) This plan was completed by the Bloomington architectural firm of Edgar Lundeen and Dean Hilfinger. The rendering also carries the name of A. Richard “Dick” Williams, a visionary University of Illinois architecture professor who later became director of the school’s Graduate Design Studio. At the time of this Baby Fold plan, Williams was serving as chief designer for Lundeen and Hilfinger. It would prove a fertile relationship, as Williams worked with the Bloomington firm on a host of post-World War II buildings in the Twin Cities that have stood the test of time as exemplars of “modern” architecture. The proposed Baby Fold campus seen here features many hallmarks of modernism, including flat roofs, slender columns and an absence of architectural embellishments. Williams grew up in the Twin Cities, the son of an Illinois State Normal University accounting professor. Graduating from the University of Illinois in 1936, he served on a U.S. Navy minesweeper in the Pacific Theater during World War II. After the war, Dick Williams settled in Champaign-Urbana to teach and practice architecture. Locally, he played a leading design role in many outstanding post-war buildings in Bloomington, including Oakland Elementary School (opened in 1951); Wesley United Methodist Church (1952); Bloomington Federal Savings and Loan Association (1957, and now part of the Government Center), Bloomington High School (1959) and City Hall (1963). He also influenced the work of other important Bloomington architects, including Gene Asbury and Wade Abels. Williams was also the design architect on many projects outside the Twin Cities, including the celebrated Education Building on the University of Illinois campus. He left the U of I in the early 1970s to concentrate on consultant work in the urban design and planning fields. This 1948 campus plan never made it to the concrete, brick and steel stage. A Baby Fold building committee, led by then-Superintendent William A. Hammitt, approved a second Lundeen and Hilfinger plan two years later. Williams had a hand in the design of the eventual campus, as a series of buildings were erected over a decade or more. Ground was broken on the first building—the nursery—in June 1950, and the first babies were moved there in the fall of 1952. Dick Williams spent the last three decades of his long life in Tucson, AZ. The “internationally known and respected architect” passed away in 2016 at the age of 101.",

    "content": "The Civil War was a brutal, decidedly unromantic slog. By its cruel end, as Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee’s armies blackened the Virginia countryside in a death match costing thousands upon thousands of lives, the four-year conflict had become a harbinger of World War I and the tactics and machinery of mass killing. On the other hand, the dashing cavalryman, sash tied around waist and sword held aloft (glinting in the sunlight, no less), remains an iconic image of the Civil War, though this figure is better suited to the supposedly more chivalric Napoleonic era of a half-century earlier. Even so, the Civil War provided plenty of larger-than-life stories of beau ideal cavalry officers. Locally, this archetype is best represented in the life and death of Lt. Col. Harvey Hogg of the 2nd Illinois Calvary. Handsome (think Elvis Presley), recklessly brave and perhaps a touch naive, Hogg died leading a doomed cavalry charge in western Tennessee. His death on August 30, 1862, gave his adopted hometown of Bloomington a war hero and martyr to the Union cause. Born in 1833 in Smith County, Tenn., east of Nashville, Hogg was raised by an uncle and attended schools in Tennessee and Virginia. Coming from a slave-owning family, he was that rarest of men in the Antebellum South—an outspoken opponent of the “peculiar institution.” Hogg’s dissertation at a college in Emory, Va., for example, was on the “Evils of Slavery,” a topic that drew the ire of the school’s faculty and president—and presumably many of his fellow students. For his part, Hogg was said to have answered back that “if I speak at all, I shall speak my honest convictions.” He then studied law at Cumberland University in Lebanon, Tenn., graduating as class valedictorian. Hogg moved to Bloomington with his wife Prudence Allcorn in the mid-1850s, and local tradition has it that he freed his last slave, “Aunt Sarah,” by bringing her to Bloomington. Yet there’s also evidence, albeit unsubstantiated, that Hogg brought Aunt Sarah to Illinois without “officially” freeing her (though the fact that she was living in Illinois made her a free person by default). When he ran for state representative in 1860, the Illinois Statesmen, a Bloomington weekly newspaper, reported that an African-American woman had fled the Hogg household. Why? According to the Statesmen, which admittedly was an “organ” of the Democratic Party (Hogg was a Republican), there were reports that this woman (likely Sarah) had overheard Hogg talk about selling her back into bondage in the South. There were even more pernicious rumors to the effect that he had already done so. What’s more likely is that Harvey and Prudie Hogg never told Sarah that she was a free person, and so once she learned the truth she left their house and went looking for work and a new life elsewhere. In 1857, Hogg formed a legal partnership with Ward H. Lamon, who would become President Abraham Lincoln’s trusted bodyguard in Washington, D.C. Lamon and Hogg’s office was above a drugstore at the corner of Center and Washington streets, on the south side of the courthouse square (this building still stands, and today is occupied by Scharnett Associates Architects). A successful attorney with a promising political career representing the newly formed anti-slavery Republican Party, Hogg was on the prosecuting team alongside Lincoln for the sensational murder trial of Isaac Wyant (they would lose the case). Hogg served as city attorney and prosecutor for the Eighth Judicial Circuit, and right before the war was a Republican state representative. Despite the unsubstantiated rumors involving Aunt Sarah, The Pantagraph described Hogg as “a consistent, conscientious, determined anti-slavery man,” albeit one who expressed his beliefs “without being fanatical.” The 2nd Illinois Cavalry organized in the summer of 1861, with Hogg as the second-in-charge lieutenant colonel. He had a decided flair for the dramatic. For instance, on the evening of March 2, 1862, he left Paducah, KY, with a small force, having learned that Rebel troops had earlier evacuated the Mississippi River community of Columbus, Ky., some 40 miles away. Before heading out, he warned his men that they might run into the enemy. “If we do,” Hogg declared, “don’t use your pistols, but give them the cold steel. The saber is the weapon for cavalry to reply upon.” “In everything Col. Hogg was a manly man,” read one of several “man-crush” tributes from his contemporaries. “Physically he was one of the finest men I ever saw; about six feet high, finely proportioned, straight as an arrow, dark hair and eyes and swarthy complexion. He was a man born to command, a natural leader.” At one point during the war Hogg returned to Bloomington to care for his ailing wife and then accompany her to Tennessee, “that she might have the care of her mother and relatives, in her last sickness.” She passed away on May 27, 1862, and Hogg brought her body back to Bloomington for burial The maelstrom of war cared not a whit for personal grief, so the young widower returned to duty. On August 30, 1862, Lt. Col. Hogg and part of the 2nd Illinois Cavalry arrived in Bolivar, Tenn., located about 70 miles east of Memphis. It was there that Hogg and a mix of Union cavalry and infantry ran into the advance of a large Confederate force. Hogg refused to retreat, instead calling his men forward with a shout of “give them cold steel boys.” According to the adjutant general’s report, the 29-year-old lieutenant colonel was hit nine times by Rebel fire. Others killed in the charge included Sgt. William Ross of LeRoy. Hogg’s body was escorted back to Bloomington, and the September 14 funeral was said to be one of the largest in the city’s history, up to that time. The procession to the city cemetery (now Evergreen Memorial) included military companies, 55 carriages and a large number of residents on foot. He was laid to rest next to Prudie and their infant daughter Mattie. “Colonel Hogg was none too good a sacrifice for the principles he died to save,” noted The Pantagraph of September 24, 1862, “but, like many others, he was too good a citizen and soldier for us to spare.” The eulogy concluded with a poem of unrestrained sentimentality common to the era. “His soul released upsoaring,” Hogg was now … Where armies clash no more, And peace shall reign forever.",

    "content": "During the 1936 Christmas season, Americans faced an Ebenezer Scrooge writ large — the hard times of the Great Depression. Even so, most area residents weren’t willing to let the “bah humbug” economy define their holidays. Beginning Monday, Dec.21, downtown Bloomington retail stores remained open until 9 p.m. each day through Christmas Eve. (Back then, they were normally closed evenings except Fridays and Saturdays.) The McLean County Courthouse was also illuminated for the holidays, giving downtown, it was said, “a gala air.” That’s not to say there wasn’t plenty of distress — economic or otherwise — in the Twin Cities a full 83 Christmases ago. The Pantagraph’s Goodfellow Fund was around in 1936, though the annual giving campaign was then spelled as two words. At this time, the fund provided fresh fruit and toys for needy children ages 12 and under, as well as canned food for families. Many of these Good Fellow toys came from the Bloomington Municipal Recreation Board, a creation of the Works Progress Administration, one of the Roosevelt administration’s cornerstone New Deal programs. The Bloomington board and its Normal counterpart sponsored a Santa’s workshop whereby volunteers reconditioned used or damaged toys collected by area Boy Scouts. Sixty some “elves” worked in shifts from 6 a.m. to midnight. There were another 24 women primarily engaged in making doll clothes. Great State Theaters, Inc., owners of the Irvin, Castle and Majestic theaters in downtown Bloomington, staged a benefit Saturday morning, December 19, whereby a donated can of food served as admission. All told, more than 1,600 cans were gathered for the Good Fellow campaign. Many of those fortunate enough to have steady employment in 1936 welcomed the hustle and bustle of holiday commerce and industry. America once moved by rail, and at the Alton Railroad Shops on Bloomington’s west side, passenger locomotives were given precedence over their freight counterparts in anticipation of the year-end increase in ridership. Accordingly, from Dec. 9 to Dec. 22, seven passenger locomotives were “shopped, repaired and placed in service.” In the second week of December, Bloomington banker and nurseryman Grover C. Helm announced the arrival by railcar of Rocky Mountain balsams. “The finest car of Christmas trees received in years,” declared Helm. “Will not shed their needles.” On December 20, Ainsworth Ice Co., 505 S. McClun St., announced the arrival of a railcar’s worth of Florida oranges (“tree-ripened, not colored.”) They also had tangerines and grapefruit on hand. And what would the holidays be without family get-togethers centered on a traditional meal? Nierstheimer Bros. grocery (with two locations—downtown Bloomington and the 1400 block of West Washington Street) offered dressed goose and duck at 22 cents a pound. (Adjusted for inflation, 22 cents would be equal to $4 today.) And in a nod to Bloomington’s old Swedish community, they also sold lingonberries and lutfisk. Many big-ticket items were at rock-bottom prices, helped by the low demand for consumer durables during the Depression. Several local businesses, including J.A. Keck Furniture Co., were selling—“at the lowest prices in history!”—locally manufactured Ice-O-Matic electric refrigerators. “As little as $3.50 [a month] puts one of these big, powerful Ice-O-Matics in your kitchen … and 36 months to pay balance!” read one advertisement. Chadband’s, a popular downtown jewelry store, promised “convenient credit at no extra cost.” Stern’s, which billed itself as “Central Illinois’ busiest furniture store,” offered a new 1937 Philco radio for $49.95, or as little as 50 cents a week on the installment plan. (By the way, that $49.95 would be the equivalent of $920 today!) This was a time when four locally owned department stores—C.W. Klemm, W.H. Roland, A. Livingston & Sons and Newmarket—went head-to-head against three national chains—Montgomery Ward, Penney’s and Sears Roebuck—in downtown Bloomington. Remarkably, all were situated within a block or so of the courthouse square. Roland’s featured a “toyland” in its basement stocked with things like the two-foot tall “Ma-Ma” talking doll for $3.98, and a Streak-o-Lite steel wagon with working headlights and a “horn that toots and toots!” for $4.95. Roland’s also had “Midget Town” wood building block sets (commercially manufactured in Bloomington by general contractor Charles E. Hall) for $1 and $1.98, and three pound boxes of Paul F. Beich Co. “Lady Betty” chocolates for $1. The Pantagraph asked several area children what they were expecting from Old Saint Nick. “I don’t need any more dolls, but I’d like to get some new clothes for the three I have,” said seven-year-old Phyllis Bender. Others, such as eight-year-old Roderic Abbott, Jr., were decidedly more ambitious. “I’d like to get a streamline train, a Tom Mix pistol, a toy ‘Tommy’ machine gun, a cowboy suit and some autos and trucks,” he said. As Christmas Day neared, the Young Men’s Club, in the form of Al Hale dressed as Santa Claus, distributed toys, clothing and candy to 18 boys and girls at the McLean County Colored Children’s Home. The Young Men’s Club also hosted a dinner at the Illinois Hotel for the residents of Victory Hall, a boys’ home in Normal. Santa Claus made an appearance here as well, divvying out everything from fountain pens to “big, sturdy sleds.” On Wednesday, December 23, the 11th annual Children’s Christmas Jubilee was held at Bloomington High School. In order to accommodate 5,000 area schoolchildren, three programs were held in the morning and two in the afternoon. The program included Christmas carols and the dramatization of “Jiminy Christmas,” a short story written by Genevieve White, an English instructor at Illinois Wesleyan University. Each child also received a bag of Beich candy. That same evening—Dec. 23, the “eve of Christmas Eve”— The Pantagraph sponsored the 10th annual “Christmas Carol Sing” on the courthouse square (see accompanying photograph.) The caroling began at 5:15 p.m. with an estimated 1,500 area residents (including 400 seventh and eighth graders) gathered on the west side of the courthouse. At the Illinois Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Children’s School, the state orphanage in Normal, Christmas Day festivities began at 6 a.m. with a brass ensemble parading from one residential cottage to another. Soon thereafter, members of the Louis E. Davis American Legion post and the local chapter of the United Spanish War Veterans distributed gifts to more than 800 children. Several restaurants remained open on Dec. 25. For 80 cents, the Quality Cafe, 414 N. Main St., offered an expansive Christmas Day menu that included Gelbach roast turkey, stuffed baked Watertown goose, Brussels sprout hollandaise, fancy California asparagus tips on toast and homemade hot mince pie. Unfortunately for area children with sleds under the Christmas tree, 1936 would prove to be one of the warmest holidays in memory. On Christmas Day, in fact, temperatures reached a high of 58 degrees.",

    "content": "Carle BroMenn Medical Center has undergone one transformation after another since its modest beginnings 125 years ago. It opened on May 8, 1896, as the 22-bed Deaconess Hospital—this nearly a quarter century before the discovery of antibiotics. Today, the medical center offers everything from cardiac electrophysiology to interventional radiology. About the only thing that hasn’t changed is its central location—where Franklin and Virginia avenues meet in Normal. Deaconess Hospital owes its origin to a group of local doctors who believed Bloomington-Normal was ready to support a second traditional hospital, specifically one not tied to the Catholic Church. St. Joseph’s Hospital, originally located on Bloomington’s west side, dates to 1880. The “Protestant” hospital got its name from non-ordained women (often Methodists)—known as deaconesses—whose ministry work included serving as nurses. It’s nigh impossible to overemphasize the profound transformations in hospital care since BroMenn’s founding years. According to its annual report of 1899, Deaconess Hospital cared for 178 patients and conducted 104 operations. “Liberal donations of bread, fruit, jellies, and flowers were received,” it was noted. “The ladies aid societies met each week to sew for the hospital. They furnished their own materials from the money received through dues of 10 cents a month.” In 1901, Deaconess Hospital changed its name to Brokaw, as tribute to its main benefactor Abram Brokaw, a Bloomington plow maker who made a small fortune investing in farmland. Brokaw is the “Bro” in BroMenn. The “Menn” comes from Mennonite Hospital, established in 1919-20 and occupying an old homeopathic sanitarium on the north end of downtown Bloomington. German Mennonites settled in Central Illinois in large numbers, and operating a hospital dovetailed with the Mennonite tradition of pastoral care and community service. The nursing school associated with this hospital thrives today as Illinois State University’s Mennonite School of Nursing. In 1984, Brokaw Hospital merged with Mennonite to create BroMenn Healthcare. The former Mennonite Hospital became a center for allied health services, such as long-term senior care. BroMenn finally vacated the old hospital in 1998, and since then most of the complex has fallen to the wrecking ball, replaced with vacant, weedy lots awaiting redevelopment. Twelve years ago, in 2009, BroMenn became part of Oak Brook-based Advocate Health Care. And then last summer, Carle Health of Urbana purchased BroMenn and Eureka hospitals for $190 million. Whew! From Deaconess Hospital to Carle BroMenn Medical Center—that’s a lot of history in 125 years. Fortunately, with the help of the McLean County Museum of History, the story of these hospitals is being saved for generations to come. In February of this year, Carle BroMenn administrators invited museum staff to the medical center complex to examine the combined archives of Brokaw, Mennonite, and BroMenn hospitals. After consultation and discussion, both parties agreed the museum was best equipped to ensure the safekeeping, preservation and cataloging of these materials. During a series of return trips in March, Museum staff methodically sorted through the piles of scrapbooks, annual reports, employee newsletters, fundraising appeals, photographs, blueprints, framed architectural renderings, nursing school yearbooks, and so on. This initial “shakedown” left 36 banker boxes worth of history. A more rigorous weeding of duplicate materials, as well as the painstaking item-by-item inventory of each subset of this collection, would wait until later. On May 19, the boxes were trucked to the museum. “We’re absolutely thrilled that [BroMenn’s] archives will now be in the great care of the McLean County Museum of History,” Tim Bassett , Carle BroMenn Vice President, Operations, said at the time. Of course, having all this historically invaluable material is great, but if students, genealogists, local residents, researchers and others aren’t aware of these donated collections, or don’t know how to access them, then what’s the point of collecting all this “stuff” in the first place? That’s why the McLean County Museum of History takes seriously its mission to not only preserve the past, but to make that history available to the public at large—today and tomorrow. As a not-for-profit institution, the museum relies to a considerable extent on volunteers and college interns to help organize and inventory these collections. This summer, the museum welcomed ISU graduate history major Dennis Baffour Awuah, who is currently organizing singular parts of the larger BroMenn collection. The museum was lucky to have an intern of Dennis’ qualifications and abilities, as he already has an impressive body of academic scholarship relating to healthcare and his home nation of Ghana. For his summer internship, Awuah first pulled together all the scattered and disparate material relating to Brokaw Hospital and nursing—including correspondence from student nurses—and then organized it all into the Brokaw Hospital Nursing Collection. Awuah's current project involves the Ruth Carpenter papers, two boxes of which were found among the BroMenn archives. Carpenter, who passed away in 2000 at the age of 90, was a 1931 graduate of the Brokaw Hospital Training School. She worked as a private duty nurse, as well as in several doctors’ offices and the Fairview Tuberculosis Sanatorium. The Carpenter collection includes her schoolwork and letters, among other treasures. With both the Brokaw Hospital Nursing and the Ruth Carpenter collections, Awuah is creating a detailed, nearly item-by-item inventory known as a finding aid. The museum will then post these finding aids on its website—www.mchistory.org—where they show up on Google and other Internet search engines. Currently, the museum has 468 such collection finding aids on its website—ranging from the Alton Railroad Community Band Collection to the Charles J. Zobrist WW I Collection. That’s not to say the collections themselves are digitized and available online for viewing and downloading (although that day will come, it’s still a way’s off.) Even so, knowing what’s out there and where it’s at is crucial to keeping our shared past alive. From there, all it takes is a visit to the McLean County Museum of History, or a phone call or email to Museum Librarian Bill Kemp. In the ensuing months, the museum will continue to organize and inventory parts of the Carle BroMenn donation, including those having to do with the earliest years of Brokaw and Mennonite hospitals. There are many forgotten stories yet to be remembered and retold.",

    "content": "As a not-for-profit institution, the McLean County Museum of History relies to a considerable extent on the generosity of the public to collect, preserve, exhibit, and make available the heritage of this area and its people. Take, for instance, this remarkable picture postcard of Moore’s Mill in southern McLean County. It was donated to the museum several weeks ago by Bloomington resident David A. Hall, a history buff, Illinois Wesleyan University Titans super fan, and museum friend and volunteer. David also keeps an eye out for historical items of local interest, and makes donations to the museum from time to time. And wow, this postcard—offering as it does a view of the mill never before seen by museum staff—is an absolute gem! Historic images—as anyone looking at old family photos can attest—are one of the more impactful means to explore and better understand the past in all its complexities. Nevertheless, you might be asking yourself, what’s so great about some old postcard showing some old mill? Well, one answer to that very good question is that the story of pioneer-era gristmills is inextricably linked to the larger narrative of Euro-American settlement. In fact, there were few matters of greater importance to the early settler than the milling of grain. Early farmers had little choice but to travel long distances to have their corn, oats, rye and wheat ground into flour or feed—the staff of life for pioneering families and their livestock. Before the proliferation of steam-powered mills, there were several dozen water mills scattered throughout McLean County, with a cluster—gristmills and sawmills alike—lining the Mackinaw River in Lexington and Money Creek townships. The most celebrated mill in McLean County, though, was the aforementioned Moore’s Mill, located on the south bank of Sugar Creek, about three miles west of the Village of McLean. Its fame mostly rests with the fact that it was last operational water-powered mill in McLean County, as it remained an ongoing concern into the 1910s. John Caton erected the mill in 1842, but not long afterward, he swapped it for 160 acres of nearby farmland. New owner Jacob Moore installed a pair of 64-inch diameter millstones, and built an “ingenious system of shafts, and cogwheels, all made of wood,” which transferred the energy of running water into the turning of millstones. Moore’s son David eventually took over the family business, and his upgrades included enlarging the dam, installing a modern turbine wheel, and replacing the hand-hewn mechanicals with steel shafting and cast-iron gears. After David Moore passed away in 1909, his son Lee kept the business going for another four years before shutting the mill down for good. Photographs—no matter how remarkable or historically illustrative—rarely tell the whole story. Luckily, the museum’s archival collections include files and original manuscripts relating to Moore’s Mill and local milling. For instance, there’s a nine-page handwritten history of the famed mill dating to 1902 and authored by W.C. Arnold, editor and manager of The McLean Lens, the town’s weekly newspaper. “Alone and completely shut in on three sides by willows and other timber growth, it is so nearly hidden that a stranger might easily pass by without discovering its presence,” observed Arnold, of the mill a dozen years before its closing. “And yet the old mill grinds on, and on,” he added, “keeping time to music of splashing water, while its dark, weather-beaten figure represents the last unbroken link to the chain of events uniting the present time with a heroic and almost forgotten past.” Romance and the supposed heroic past aside, it’s important to remember that water mills—though picturesque they might be—were also engines of Euro-American settlement. As such, they were harbingers of the rapid conquest of the land and the indigenous people who had called it home. The McLean County Museum of History boasts not only an exceptional archive and library, but also an object collection numbering some 20,000 items—everything from Civil War rifles to wedding dresses. And when it comes to the story of Moore’s Mill, we’re in luck. In 2005, Bonnie Schultz gifted to the museum several salvaged parts of mill’s gear assembly, all likely dating to the 1870s. Let us now return to the postcard donated by David A. Hall, for the reverse side points to a fascinating chapter of McLean County history—though one wholly unrelated to Moore’s Mill itself! “Genuine photo by C.U. Williams, Bloomington, Ill.,” reads a printed message on the backside. A Brooklyn, N.Y. native, Charles U. Williams came to Bloomington in 1867, establishing himself as a photographer and successful picture postcard manufacturer. He enjoyed a divinely profitable venture by printing and selling tens of thousands of postcards featuring evangelist and tent show revivalist Billy Sunday, one of the more colorful national figures in the first two decades of the 20th century. C.U. Williams and his son Walter then partnered to manufacture oil-burning home heaters, marketing them as a cleaner alternative to sooty, coal-fired furnaces. In 1945, Williams Oil-O-Matic merged with Detroit-based Eureka Co. to become vacuum maker Eureka-Williams of Bloomington. The company later dropped the “Williams” half of its name. Luckily, the postcard’s reverse also includes a handwritten note that connects it to the past on a more personal level. Sent from the McLean Post Office in December 1915 by someone identified only as “Ollie,” the card is addressed to a Miss Fern Loffer of Urbana, Ill. (though the surname is a best guess, as it’s partly illegible.) “Hello Fern,” the message begins. “We will be over Tuesday [illegible word.] The big four will get off at Champaign. Mother and Hazel are having quite a time. Will be there Tuesday [illegible word] Ollie.” The “Big Four Railroad” mentioned here—officially known as the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway—ran between Bloomington and Champaign. A cursory search has turned up little in the way of clues about the sender (Ollie) or addressee (Fern). If you can help fill any gaps, please contact the museum at BKemp@mchistory.org. Anyway, how did we get from Moore’s Mill to C.U. Williams, and then, to Ollie and Fern? That’s the joy of history—especially of the local sort. Dig just a little into the past and the stories unfold one after another, each one a window into a lost world.",

    "content": "“More from the soil, with less toil” was the promise of the Illinois Tractor Co., which for a few short years sold its Bloomington-made tractors across the nation and even overseas. This was in the late 1910s and early 1920s, when the promise of “power farming”—that is, replacing horses with machines—captivated much of rural America. As such, the Illinois Tractor Co. competed against a seemingly innumerable number of manufacturers—Aultman & Taylor, Avery, Bull, Case, Hart-Parr, Holt Caterpillar, International Harvester, Parrett and many other smaller concerns, the names of which today are known only to those who collect and restore antique tractors. The Illinois Tractor Co. originally manufactured farm silos, incorporating in 1912 as the Illinois Silo Co. From its plant on the south side of Bloomington between Lincoln and Lafayette streets (roughly where Behr Iron and Metal is located today), it also sold farm machinery and building tile. By 1916, the renamed Illinois Silo and Tractor Co. (the “silo” in the name would be dropped in a year or two) began touting its new tractor, said to be the first “motor-driven machine” made in Bloomington. “Does any work on the farm that a four-horse team will do,” it was said. Unlike the company’s next generation, more modern-looking tractors, these early ones were ungainly looking contraptions with exposed gears and belts. By 1919, the company was selling the first model in its “Illinois Super-Drive” line of tractors (see accompanying images.) John B. Foote—“the country’s leading tractor transmission expert,” according to the company’s promotional material—is said to have devoted “three years of continuous work” developing the Super-Drive. Whether that’s true or not we cannot say, but in point of fact, Foote-designed transmissions were well known back then. The Super-Drive’s “live-axle, spring cushion drive,” claimed the company, “delivers more engine power at the drawbar than any other driving principle now in tractor use.” The rear axle “applies power direct to the rims of the drive wheels—not to the hubs or spokes—through cushion springs which relieve the entire mechanism from all jars or shocks.” These tractors were assembled in Bloomington, with most of the components and parts coming from elsewhere. Its kerosene motors were manufactured by the Climax Engineering Co. of Clinton, Ia., for instance, while the carburetors came from the Stromberg Motor Devices Co. of Chicago; Spirex radiators from Modine Mfg. Co. of Racine, Wisc.; Sylphon thermostats from the Fulton Company of Knoxville, Tenn.; etc. Even so, the tractor’s under frame and other parts were likely designed and manufactured in Bloomington. The company employed pattern makers here, and maintained a large inventory of sheet metal, floor plating and steel. In the first months of 1919, the company’s some 60 factory hands were assembling nine to twelve tractors a week. It was around this time that the Illinois Super-Drive appeared in tractor trade shows and field exhibitions across the Midwest, Great Plains and beyond. The tractor, proclaimed the company, “has gone into the field under practically every soil and weather condition, in high and low altitudes, and has demonstrated its ability to successfully handle four 14-inch plows in sod or stubble at a depth of from six to eight inches and at a speed of from two and a half to three and a half miles per hour.” At one time, it appears direct factory branches opened in Fargo, N.D., Kansas City, Mo., and elsewhere. And at some point, the company licensed a Canadian manufacturer to make Super-Drives under the Imperial name. By the fall of 1919, The Pantagraph reported that an Illinois Tractor Co. overseas representative in Paris had closed a contract for 200 Super-Drive tractors. At the same time, Nat B. Lay, engineer and head of the service department, was heading to Europe to help establish a permanent presence on the continent. The ambitious company had already opened an export office in New York City. “More than a year ago we recognized the opportunity for marketing our product in foreign fields, particularly in Europe,” B.F. Sprankle, general manager of the company, remarked at the time. “Our first move was a carefully planned advertising campaign, conducted through widely circulated export journals. Before we had received an export order for a single tractor, the names ‘Illinois Super-Drive’ and ‘Bloomington, U.S.A.,’ were known in every foreign agricultural country.” Despite such supposed name recognition, the company sank under the weight of mismanagement, undercapitalization, stiff competition and likely other insurmountable problems. In early 1921, there were hopeful whispers that the floundering company would be absorbed by “one of the largest automotive concerns” in the nation. Alas, it was not to be. One year later, in Jan. 1922, stockholders filed bills of relief against the Illinois Tractor Co. and its officers. According to a series of complaints, the company cooked the books to create a fictitious surplus, inflate year-to-year profits and underreport mounting losses. The aggrieved stockholders also claimed that one company official sold stock on 25 to 50 commission, and that its “officers and directors declared annual dividends of 8 percent to holders of stock to instill confidence and induce others to buy.” All Ponzi-like schemes rest on a house of cards, and this one came tumbling down soon enough, On May 2, 1923, bankruptcy trustee W.B. Leach held a sale of more than 54 tons of company steel. On Dec. 4 of that year, a public sale of Illinois Tractor Co. assets netted between $11,000 and $12,000, with tractors selling from $300 to $690 each (or $4,400 to $10,200 in today’s dollars, adjusted for inflation.) The following year, 1924, International Harvester began selling its McCormick-Deering Farmall, the first commercially successful, all-purpose tractor featuring the classic “tricycle” design, though it would be another eight years before pneumatic tires replaced steel wheels. The archives of the McLean County Museum of History include a collection of material on the Illinois Tractor Co. In this collection are several dozen photographs—both of finished tractors and component parts—as well as a published instruction book and parts list for the Model C tractor. Today, it’s believed that there are but a handful of surviving tractors built by the short-lived Illinois Tractor Co. In the summer of 1988, Jim Adams of rural Bloomington had his two 1919 Illinois Super-Drives restored by a farm equipment repair business near Effingham, Ill. Adams, a steam engine collector, debuted one or both of the tractors that fall during the 50th anniversary of the Central States Threshermen’s Reunion in Pontiac. These two Super-Drives were originally purchased by a North Dakota farmer, who then hid them from scrappers during World War II. After Adams’ passing, the tractors were sold by Aumann Auctions, Inc. of Nokomis, Ill. One tractor went to a buyer in North Carolina and the other one to a buyer in Missouri.",

    "content": "Although born out of the Roaring Twenties, dance marathons and walkathons peaked in popularity during the 1930s and the Great Depression. These competitions featured desperate, unemployed folks shambling around a dance floor or indoor track day after day, week and week, all the while hoping to be the last contestant standing so they could take home the top cash prize. The public found these events, similar in some ways to reality television today, a form of cheap and occasionally riveting entertainment. Participants, some of whom became local celebrities, lived in a bubble as they danced or walked (and even slept) each and every day before the paying public. The main draw, of course, was the inherent drama of desperate couples or individuals pitted against each other in a pitiless test of endurance. Writers and social commentators have made much of the parallel between the fatigue and suffering of a nation and its people in the midst of the Great Depression, and the raw and weary spectacle of these marathon contests. The area’s first dance marathon to garner significant attention took place during the summer of 1928, several months before “Black Tuesday” and the start of the Depression. It was held on the polished hardwood floor of the Bon-Go Park pavilion on the south edge of Bloomington (now G.J. Mecherle Memorial Park, commonly known as State Farm Park). The event got off to a fitting Jazz Age start on June 22, with a parade of some 25 contestants dancing the several miles from the Courthouse Square to Bon-Go Park. The competition included eight couples from Bloomington and Decatur—four from each community—competing for $325 in prize money (the equivalent of $4,500 today, adjusted for inflation). Dancers were allowed two hours sleep between 2 and 4 a.m., and 10 minutes of rest each hour. Event organizers also held public dances most evenings from 8 p.m. to midnight, with the George C. Goforth Orchestra of Bloomington providing the music. Those paying the 10 cent admission could thus dance alongside the “marathoners” or simply watch as they dragged themselves to and fro in a half-stupor. On June 28, Don Dugan and Dorothy Bardwell of Bloomington dropped out after Dugan began suffering chest pains. The competition finally came to an end around 5:30 a.m. on Monday, July 9, when Roy Valentine and Luella Hefner of Bloomington failed to take the floor after a rest period (the third-place couple, Don Wise and Francis Montague of Decatur, had dropped out a few days earlier). Apparently, Hefner had heeded repeated entreaties to call it quits by family members worried about her health. That left Jack Moreland and Lucille Bowman of Bloomington champions after 396 hours on the dance floor. Bunnell Bros, a local shoe store on the south side of the Courthouse Square, soon advertised the Bostonian brand shoes Moreland wore during the competition. It was said he had danced more than 300 hours in one pair of Bostonians without leaving a single callus on his feet. Bloomington was home to several competitive marathon dancers, including out-of-work 19-year-old Charles Roberts, who in the fall of 1930 surpassed 1,000 hours at a Peoria competition dancing with “pretty and plucky” Evelyn Zepp. The previous year Roberts had captured the top prize in a Champaign, Ill. dance marathon. Sunny Slope Pavilion, located near Bon-Go Park but on the west side of Rt. 2 (now U.S. Highway 51), also hosted several early 1930s dance marathons. In the summer of 1932, for example, the venue, located at the future site of the now-demolished Bloomington Sale Barn, played host to a competition that lasted more than 40 days. The human capacity to endure monotony, repetition, humiliation, and exhaustion, both physical and mental, is always a thing of wonder. As marathon dances dragged interminably onward, organizers often resorted to punishing rule changes and mini-tests of stamina designed to winnow the field or crown a champion. Rest and / or sleep breaks were shortened or eliminated altogether, for instance, and “sprints” of feverishly paced dancing were interspersed between the monotonous shuffling. Sydney Pollack’s gritty film “They Shoot Horses, Don’t They?” from 1969, starring Jane Fonda and Gig Young, takes place during a Great Depression-era dance marathon on the Santa Monica Pier in California. Although the film is known for its dark mood, gloomy atmospherics and violent denouement, it played a role in the resurgence of marathon dancing in the early 1970s, especially on college campuses where the edgy film found a natural audience. Northwestern University, to cite one of the more better known examples, has staged a philanthropic dance marathon since 1972. And last weekend, Sat., March 5, Illinois Wesleyan University held a 12-hour dance marathon for the benefit of the Children’s Hospital of Illinois in Peoria. Back during the Great Depression, dance marathons eventually fell out of favor and were replaced by walkathons, at least locally. Beginning in 1934, the Louis E. Davis American Legion Post 56 sponsored several fundraising walkathons at the old Bloomington Coliseum. The Legion charged admission so spectators could watch contestants circle the cavernous main floor. Public dances were also held many evenings simultaneously with the competition, and vaudeville acts sometimes performed during rest periods. The collections of the McLean County Museum of History include a Coliseum walkathon program from the spring of 1934. This contest got underway on March 22 with more than 60 participants, including those from Los Angeles, New York, St. Louis and Chicago. Bloomington participants included local walkathon legend Johnny Ellsworth and his partner Cora Helmick. By April 16, the date of this program, there were eleven couples and two solo dancers still walking the Coliseum track. That same day, April 16, two of the remaining walkathon contestants, Marjorie Mollman, 19, of Lockport, Ill., and Charles O. Ripley, 21, of Paducah, Ky., were married before 3,500 spectators at the Coliseum. After a marriage ceremony officiated by Justice of the Peace Rolla Jones, the bride and groom stepped back onto the track and continued the walkathon. The really interesting thing was the newlyweds were on different teams.",

    "content": "A single photograph can open a door into a lost world. This Bloomington Bloomers team photo, for instance, taken at Fans Field during the 1920 season, tells us a lot about the National Pastime in the early decades of the 20th century—the game itself, the men who played it, and the nation that embraced it. Seven of the 14 Bloomers shown here played in the Major Leagues, though most didn’t stay long—having, it’s said, little more than the proverbial “cup of coffee” when they got there. Bloomington was once part of the Illinois-Indiana-Iowa League, an established, well-respected minor league which over the years was home to some of the game’s greatest—hall of famers Mordecai “Three Finger” Brown (who first played for Terre Haute in 1901), Carl Hubbell (Decatur, 1927), Hank Greenberg (Evansville, 1931), Burleigh “Old Stubble Beard” Grimes (Bloomington, pitcher-manager, 1935), and a surprisingly large number of others. In 1920, the Bloomington Bloomers captured their second consecutive Three-I League pennant with an 82-57 record. The eight-team league that season featured the Evansville Evas, Cedar Rapids Rabbits, Moline Plowboys, Peoria Tractors, Rock Island Islanders, Rockford Rox and the Terre Haute Browns. Looking at this photo, the man in the white shirt and tie is Charles P. “Charlie” Goelzer (1868-1927), president of the Bloomington (Baseball) Fan Association, the organization which owned and operated the minor league club. Coming from Appleton, Wisc., Goelzer settled in Bloomington, marrying Anna Holland and becoming the manager of the clothing department at My Store, a bustling downtown retailer. In 1924, he opened his own clothing store with son Norval. This photograph and many other treasures recently came to the McLean County Museum of History from a great-granddaughter of Goelzer's living in Michigan. She was in the Twin Cities in early September for an interment service at a local cemetery, which proved an opportune time to donate a collection of Goelzer and Karr family photographs and papers to the history museum. Other fascinating items in this collection include a set of letters of recommendation for Rae Gertrude Goelzer (1891-1972), Charlie and Ann’s daughter, who was an Illinois State Normal University graduate applying for a teaching position in 1910. Rae married Lee J. Karr in 1912, who was born and raised on a farm in Shirley. Also donated to the museum were Karr family rationing stamps dating to World War II, and other equally fascinating items. This 1920 team photo includes seven major leaguers, but only Robert Roy Fothergill (back row, fifth from left) enjoyed sustained success on the game’s biggest stage. The 22-year-old rookie from Massillon, OH, led the 1920 Three Eye season in hits, runs batted in (RBIs) and batting average. He would go on to play 12 seasons in the majors, with most of that spent as a key reserve outfielder with the Ty Cobb-led Detroit Tigers. Fothergill sure looks plenty fit and trim here, but during his big league days he packed on the pounds, earning various nicknames, including “Rob Roy the Tiger Fat Boy.” A consummate showman, “Rotund Robert” was known for his swan dive slide into the bases. Such stories make the National Pastime a national treasure, but we cannot forget that baseball carries not only the blessings of the American experience, but its curses as well. In this team photo, for instance, there are no people of color because Major League Baseball and the affiliated minor leagues excluded Black ballplayers. The “color line” would not begin to crumble until 1947 when Jackie Robinson debuted with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Back in August 1920, the Bloomington Bloomers dealt Fothergill and right-handed pitcher Allen Conkwright (left of Fothergill) to Detroit. The 23-year-old Conkwright, who went 24-7 with the Bloomers in 1920, ended up starting 3 games for the Tigers late that season. Sadly, he never made it back to the majors. Sac City, Ia. native Paul Zahniser (back row, second on the right) was a key member of Bloomington’s 1919 and 1920 championship teams. The righthander had been on loan to Bloomington in a gentlemen’s agreement with the Toledo Mud Hens of the American Association. He then spent the next two years winning 42 games for Memphis of the Southern Association. From there it was four seasons in the American League—two apiece with Washington and Boston. He struggled, however, going 25-47 in four years—losing nearly twice as many games as won. Zahniser even led the A.L. in pitching losses with 18 in 1926, his last season with Red Sox. There were also four veterans on the Bloomers 1920 roster who had played in the big leagues earlier in their careers. Bloomers Manager Joe Dunn (left of Goelzer)—35 years old during the 1920 season—appeared in 30 games over 2 seasons (1908-1909) for the National League Brooklyn Superbas (later renamed the Dodgers). Dunn’s Major League Baseball career was short-lived, but he enjoyed success as a minor league skipper. Pitcher Matt Zieser (first row, second from left) finished the 1920 season with a 19-10 record. The 31-year-old righthander (the name is misspelled in the photo), though, was nearing the end of his playing career, which earlier included appearing in 2 games for the 1914 Boston Red Sox—a “sip” of coffee, you might call it. Although the middle figure in the first row is identified as “Jansen,” it’s almost certain that the ballplayer is Heinie Jantzen, the Bloomers’ 30-year-old right fielder. Bloomington was the last stop on Jantzen’s professional baseball career, which included playing in 31 games for the 1912 American League St. Louis Browns. Early in playing career, outfielder Shag Thompson (front row, far right) appeared in 48 games over 3 seasons (1914-1916) for the American League Philadelphia Athletics. He never made it back to the big leagues, and instead spent a decade toiling in relative anonymity in the minors. In many ways, the story of baseball is as much the story of James Alfred “Shag” Thompson as it is the story of one George Herman “Babe” Ruth Jr.",

    "content": "Rape was the “least-reported, least-prosecuted, and least-punished” of crimes in the 19th century. On Feb. 18, 1874, Lyman S. Anderson of Springfield was arraigned in McLean County Circuit Court for the rape of Gertrude Holman. At the time Holman was a 14-year-old girl living at the Illinois Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Children’s School, the state-run orphanage once located in north Normal. Anderson admitted to having intercourse with Holman, but maintained it was with her consent. In the end the court dismissed the case because Holman “did not defend the citadel of her honor with sufficient valor.” Sadly, this appalling lack of justice when it came to women and rape was the rule, rather than the exception, in the decades before and after the Civil War. “Women,” noted Susan Krause in her study of sexual assault and Illinois courts in the mid-19th century, “were discouraged from reporting rapes because courts historically did not prosecute the rapists, and women were unwilling to subject themselves to public scrutiny and humiliation as victims.” The “good old days,” in other words, were never nearly as good as we’d like to think—or hope—they were. Attorneys, judges and juries—the justice system was an all-male bastion at the time—were inclined to excuse rape if perpetrated on “lewd” or sexually promiscuous women. This was certainly the case in McLean County. And for those cases that went to trial, the reputation of the woman—that is, her chastity—often became the central issue. Local resident James Downey was arrested on Dec. 26, 1874 for attempted rape when he and a friend invited two women up to a room on the 300 block of North Main Street in downtown Bloomington. “Downey, being under the influence of liquor, insisted on having intercourse with Mrs. [Minnie] Golding, and upon her refusal to grant his wishes, he attacked her, threw her down, choked her, and attempted to accomplish his purpose forcibly,” it was reported. The defense argued that Golding was a prostitute and therefore the “principal controversy between them was not whether the intercourse should be had, but simply the price to be paid for it.” The misogynist double-standard women faced in the courtroom was in full evidence here. “The notoriously bad character of both the women in the case will prevent any great outflow of public sympathy for them,” noted The Pantagraph. If anyone was to be pitied in the “disgraceful affair,” it was added, it was Downey’s wife and his children. “Beardless boys, married rakes, church members, nearly all the lawyers and law students, gray-haired and bald-headed men, farmers, dry good clerks, merchants and others” packed the courtroom eager to hear the “mass of lascivious details.” In doing so, the puerile and gossipy crowd turned the grim proceedings into a sad spectacle. In its Feb. 26, 1875 verdict, the jury found Downey guilty of assault and battery, but not assault with intent to commit rape. Few rape cases ever made it the grand jury. And when they did, the grand jury often declined to indict, or the state’s attorney declined to prosecute. Abraham Lincoln, for instance, was involved in seven known cases involving rape or assault with intent to rape during his years on the Eighth Judicial Circuit. The state’s attorney declined to act in four cases, while two others, in which Lincoln represented the defendants, were thrown out. Yet when it came to the horror of statutory rape and the molestation of small children the justice system could act in a quick and decisive manner. Thus it’s not surprising that the only known rape case in Lincoln’s career that went to trial involved a young girl. During the May 1853 term of the Tazewell County Circuit Court, Lincoln served as state’s attorney pro tem (a stand-in for the absent state’s attorney) in the successful prosecution of an Irish laborer for the rape of a seven-year-old girl. Stories of adolescents and younger children repeatedly raped by predatory males were all-too common in 19th century McLean County. On Sept. 9, 1869, Justices of the Peace Goodman Ferre and Alex Steele examined Dr. E. Nichols, a rural schoolteacher, on charges that he sexually assaulted his twelve-year-old sister-in-law. At the time the accused resided in Blue Mound Township northeast of Normal. He and his wife lived with her father, Elisha Wright. The twelve-year-old victim, Lizzie Wright, was the younger sister of Nichols’ wife. Nichols assaulted Lizzie for the first time in March 1869. The two were walking across a field on the way to the one-room school where she attended and he taught, when he set upon her and “villainously outraged her person.” The abuse that followed took a familiar pattern. “By threats and persuasion he worked upon her so that she kept the matter silent,” it was said, “and afterwards, having obtained control of her mind, he repeated the offense at his own pleasure.” At the end of the 1869-1870 school year Lizzie kept house for Nicols and his ailing wife, “thus affording him opportunities to complete the ruin he had commenced.” It wasn’t until August 1870 that Lizzie’s mother learned “the terrible truth, that not only had her young child been outraged, but that she was also far advanced in pregnancy.” After his arrest Nichols forfeited is bail and fled the coming reckoning. He wasn’t the only accused McLean County rapist to become a fugitive from justice, as it was far easier to run and hide in 19th century America than it is today. What happened to Lizzie Wright? Well, she gave birth to Nichols’ child in early 1870. Four years later, at the age of 17, she married John F. Jackson, eight years her senior. The 1880 U.S. Census shows Lizzie and her husband, who was in the laundry business, living in Bloomington. They had three children, Maud, Myrtle and Mable, ages five to ten months, though none of those ages match her first child, which she delivered when she was 13 years old. The eventual fate of that child, whether it died in infancy or was given up for adoption, is unknown. Not long after moving to Missouri Lizzie gave birth to a fourth daughter with the appropriately alliterative name of Marie. By 1900, Lizzie was a 52-year-old widow living in Jackson County, Missouri. Her four daughters, though, were still listed as living at home. One can only hope that Lizzie found some escape from the horrors of the past, and some measure of peace, in the love and support of her daughters.",

    "content": "Back in 1955, Bloomington was less than half its current size, toys were still made in America, stores offered free home delivery of everything from women’s hats to men’s slippers, and any serious holiday shopping had to be done downtown. Bloomington residents have always loved to buy and sell things, a likely measure of the city’s German-influenced mercantilist sensibility. As early as 1865, The Pantagraph reported that downtown stores “were full of happy people, most of them buying Christmas gifts and anticipating a merry Christmas.” Things were much the same 90 years later, as area residents flocked downtown for the 1955 holiday season. “Women buy neckties or cufflinks, men buy perfume and frilly nightgowns. Everybody buys toys for the little ones,” remarked Pantagraph reporter Tom Gumbrell, who surveyed the downtown scene two weeks before Christmas. “Santa Claus is everybody with a dime in his pocket.” In 1955, the three largest local retailers, Klemm’s, Livingston’s, and Rolands, were located on the courthouse square, holding their own against national department stores Montgomery Ward, J.C. Penney and Sears, Roebuck and Co. All six competitors were within three blocks of each other, which made for crowded downtown sidewalks come December. This was the era of postwar consumer affluence. By the mid-1950s, middle and upper-middle class shoppers were snapping up televisions for their dens and “rec” rooms. Livingston’s offered the new “swivel base” 21-inch General Electric TV for $249.95 (or the equivalent of around $2,300 in inflation-adjusted 2017 dollars). “Easy weekly or monthly payments!” noted the holiday advertisement The Bloomington Association of Commerce reminded area shoppers that downtown stores were open until 9 p.m. the week before Christmas. The Stern Furniture Co. on the 500 block of North Main Street advertised a 5-piece TV “trayette” set for $9.95; Biasi’s Drug Store on the square’s east side had Remington Duchess lady electric shavers for $21.50; and City Sales and Service at 115 E. Front St. sold the new Zenith Royal-500 all-transistor pocket radio for $75 (equal to about $690 today). From the late 1940s until the mid-1970s, Livingston’s, on the south side of the square, hoisted two giant Santas (pictured here) onto its overhang. The two identical Santas measured some 13 or so feet in height and were probably made of some early plastic or fiberglass material. Clothing has long been a popular choice during the gift-giving season. Roland’s, located on the north side of the square, offered Barbizon quilted rayon satin loungers carrying names like “Pretty Puff” and “Lady-at-Ease.” For little girls there were Cinderella party frocks, “exquisite as the tinkle of silver bells,” with names like “Upsy-Daisy” and “Goody-Goody.” The Woolen Mill Store on the 400 block of North Main Street sold a wide range of menswear, including Campus-brand sport shirts, Essley dress shirts, Pleetway pajamas and Wembley ties. With the increasing popularity of the automobile came increasing complaints about the parking situation downtown. The Pantagraph reported that city officials faced “mounting ire” over strict enforcement of the one- and two-hour time limits for parking. For years, Klemm’s “toyland” was a favorite destination for area children. The department store on the square’s north side featured dolls, carriages, gun-and-holster sets, Lincoln Logs, tricycles, pull toys and other “happy gifts.” Murray’s Hobbyland on the 100 block of North Main Street sold the wildly popular Betsy Wetsy doll. “She drinks! She sleeps! She weeps! She wets!” proclaimed a December advertisement. There was also the “Pall-Eey Meno Rider,” one of those wooden horses suspended by springs. At $9.95, it was called a “rockin’, sockin’ value.” Carl’s Tire Store on the 300 block of South Main even got into the toy business by offering 20 complete Lionel train sets at a 25 percent discount. All this holiday spending sometimes stretched family budgets past the breaking point. “Don’t let the lack of ready cash stop you from giving that unusual Christmas gift!” suggested Peer Loan Co. Inc., located above Walgreen’s on the square. “Loans to fit your needs,” was the promise. “Payments to fit your budget,” From a holiday entertainment standpoint, much has remained the same in the intervening 62 years between then and now. During the week before Christmas 1955, for instance, the Castle Theatre showed “White Christmas” with Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye (This classic musical is playing at the Normal Theater this weekend!). And on Dec. 24, WJBC AM 1230 programming included a dramatization of Charles Dickens’ “A Christmas Carol,” sponsored by Bloomington Federal Savings and Loan Association, and the 11 p.m. airing of Second Presbyterian Church’s Christmas Eve service. And what would the holidays be without a good stiff drink (or two or more) under the belt? “Say merry Christmas with a gift of fine whiskey,” suggested National Wine & Liquor, with three locations in Bloomington-Normal. A fifth of Schenley’s was $3.75, while Old Stitzel went for $4.75. Duncan Liquors on the corner of Front and Center streets sold 7-, 9- and 12-year-old imported Irish whiskey for $5.98 a fifth. Better yet, the store offered free delivery in “no-name” trucks so your busybody neighbor wouldn’t know about your boozy proclivities come Christmastime. Sadly, the glory days of downtown Bloomington were numbered. In 1962, Kmart became the first major retail store on the Route 66 “Beltline” (today Veterans Parkway), and five years later Eastland Mall opened, taking with it Sears and Penney’s. Back in 1955, even world-weary Pantagraph newsman Tom Gumbrell had to admit that, just like the song “Silver Bells,” Bloomington’s bustling sidewalks were “dressed in holiday style,” with “children laughing, and people passing, meeting smile after smile.” It was “Christmas time in the city,” with the historic brick buildings of downtown serving as splendid backdrop for all the good cheer. As Gumbrell stood downtown and looked about, his newsman’s heart softened with the sights and sounds of the season. “Christmas isn’t all commercial like some folks say,” he wrote. “At least, that’s the way it appears in this corner.”",

    "content": "“The devil was completely knocked out at Heyworth this morning at 2 o’clock,” declared The Daily Leader of Bloomington on Feb. 9, 1891. “Knocked out” was not the devil himself, mind you, but rather the Heyworth Christian Church organ. Did you say organ? That’s right, for in the 19th century many Protestant churches and faiths were roiled by the introduction of instrumental music into worship services. In Heyworth, a village about 15 miles south of Bloomington, this debate reached a fiery denouement when several individuals carried the Christian Church organ outside and set it ablaze. This controversy pitted traditionalists who favored more austere worship services patterned after the practices of early Christianity against modernizers wanting to liven things up with instrumental music and other “improvements.” The Heyworth Christian Church was born out of the Restoration Movement of the 19th century that sought to unify all Christian denominations under one church. Central Illinois proved fertile ground for what’s also known as the Stone-Campbell Movement, named after its two leaders, Barton W. Stone and Thomas Campbell. Other local denominations experienced “organ debates.” In 1855, the Methodist Church in Bloomington purchased a melodeon, a type of reed organ popular in the 19th century. This was apparently one of several issues (another being the practice of renting pews) that precipitated the split among Bloomington Methodists and the establishment of First and Grace Methodist respectively (these two churches then rejoined in the mid-20th century to form the Wesley United Methodist). Opposition to organ music at the Christian Church in Bloomington led to one or more attempts to pitch the “devil” off the gallery and onto the pews. According to one source, several women in fact did succeed in smashing the organ to pieces. Yet the division between traditionalists and modernizers was often more pronounced in the Restoration Movement. Alexander Campbell, for one, declared in the early 1850s that instrumental music during worship “would be as a cow bell in a concert” to the ears of all good Christians. The Heyworth Christian Church dates to the winter of 1870-1871 when Restoration Movement evangelist J.S. Stagner staged what was, for all intents and purposes, a seven-week revival. Full immersion baptisms were held at Kickapoo Creek north of Heyworth, with worshippers having to cut through ice to get to the water. By 1891, though, this was no backwoods primitive church. “The society membership is quite large and composed of a number of substantial and influential people,” it was noted at the time. Despite its relative affluence and influence, the Heyworth church remained one of a dwindling number of area holdouts when it came to instrumental music. “Since its organization the saints and sinners have furnished the music by voice of mouth alone,” noted The Daily Leader of Bloomington in a somewhat tongue-in-cheek recap of the organ controversy. “No ungodly brazen horns or rasping fiddle or mournful ‘organette’ ever disgraced the portals of that sanctuary. The devil’s music could not desecrate the solemnity of that house of worship.” Stone-Campbell Movement churches, especially those in the North, were certainly not impervious to the immense influences of a rapidly industrializing nation evermore interconnected and urban. By the late 1880s, for instance, a majority of Restoration churches made use of instrumental music in worship services. Yet the debate wasn’t settled among members of this vibrant movement, as evident by Daniel Sommer’s 1889 “Address and Declaration,” delivered from Sand Creek, Shelby County, Ill. This conservative call to arms railed against the modernizing tide of organ music, padded pews and the like. Although services at the Heyworth church remained music-free (save a cappella hymns), pressure began mounting within the congregation for change. “As the days and the years went by rising generations became zealous to do things as they are done in the cities,” continued The Leader. “The tiresome songs, unaccompanied by any instrument, was to them torture. They longed to listen to the whining of an organ.” And indeed, by the early 1890s a majority of Heyworth Christian Church congregants expressed support for instrumental music during worship. Recognizing the change in attitudes, the church committee in early 1891 agreed to the purchase of a Kimball organ for about $100 (the equivalent of more than $2,600 today, adjusted for inflation) from J.T. Adams’ music store in downtown Bloomington. With the purchase of the organ, some congregants, including two charter members, vowed to leave the church. The Leader noted that “certain ladies and gentlemen withdrew their names from the books and walked from the place while yet holy and untainted by sin of a church organ.” The debate between pro- and anti-organ “factions” continued in the local press, even after the installation of the Heyworth Christian Church organ. The long-simmering controversy reached a head the night / early morning of Feb. 8-9, 1891. It was at that time that at least two individuals gained entry into the church, dragged the organ out onto the street, stuffed its innards with straw, doused it in coal oil and set it afire. By the time neighbors were alerted to what had happened it was too late. The organ, quipped The Leader, “no longer exists to serve his satanic majesty.” On Feb. 10, the Christian Church paid J.T. Adams in full for the “cremated” organ and immediately placed an order for a second one. It’s not known if anyone was eventually arrested for the crime, and if so, if they were ever tried and sentenced. The anti-organ folks fiercely denied they had anything whatsoever to do with the conflagration. And to their credit, they remained vocal in their anti-organ convictions, despite hostility emanating from certain corners. On Feb. 16, a Hudson resident using the moniker “O.R. Gan,” wrote to The Leader declaring enough is enough. “It would be a great blessing to humanity if the Bloomington papers would choke off that miserable organ racket by not giving space to those that want to air their views,” announced the exasperated reader. O.R. Gan’s worries were for naught. Heyworth soon quieted down, and so did things at the Christian Church. The installation of the new organ apparently proceeded without incident and it remained a part of worship service into the early 20th century. A Baldwin piano replaced the organ and was used in that capacity until 1952 when it was moved to the nursery. A Wurlitzer piano then took the place of the old Baldwin. Today, the melodious strains of a Wicks pipe organ accompanies services at Heyworth Christian Church. Poet Will Carleton of Michigan addressed the church organ controversy in his 1873 collection “Farm Ballads.” The poem, the aptly titled “The New Church Organ,” details in a folksy vein one wary parishioner’s refusal to accept “bold, new-fangled ways.” It concludes: And when the folks get up to sing— Whene’er that time shall be— I do not want no patent thing A-squealin’ over me!",

    "content": "In 1810, 24-year-old attorney Henry Marie Brackenridge traveled down the Ohio River to Ste. Genevieve, Mo. and what was still known as the French Illinois Country. Upon passing Louisville his party encountered the unrivalled natural spectacle of the passenger pigeon, once the most abundant bird on earth. “In part of the river where the vision extended at least ten miles down … the whole heavens to the edge of the horizon were covered and concealed by a flight of wild pigeons and remained so for upwards of two hours,” Brackenridge later wrote. “During the whole day immense flocks continued to pass.” Brackenridge, a reliable observer of the American frontier, estimated the size of the principal flock at 10 miles wide and 120 miles in length. This staggering account was no exaggeration, squaring as it does with many such 19th century observations, including those of ornithologist James Audubon. Passenger pigeons—which as late as the mid-19th century numbered in the billions—were found in the forests of North America’s eastern half. Although Central Illinois was mostly tallgrass prairie, the timber along its rivers and streams and in its scattered groves was enough to sustain, at times, prodigious numbers of these birds. In this part of the state they would appear in great abundance several weeks in the spring and then again in the fall. William B. Carlock, born in 1842 in a log cabin about 12 miles northwest of Bloomington, recalled the “great flocks of wild pigeons” that would pass through McLean and Woodford counties in the spring. He also mentioned the communal pigeon stews and fries held by the early pioneers. Rev. John W. Denning, the longtime minister of First Methodist Church of Normal, settled in the area as a young boy in 1849. “Wild pigeons were so numerous that, in their flights, they darkened the sun,” he said. “They congregated in such numbers at their roosting places that large branches were broken off the trees. People did not waste powder and shot on them in those days; they simply killed them by knocking them off their roosts with long poles.” A network of railroads began linking Central Illinois communities in the early 1850s, speeding the demise of the passenger pigeon. Railroads gave hunters the means to travel considerable distances to the site of large roosting colonies. And with railroads came the telegraph and the ability to make known the location of colonies to interested parties both far and wide. These twin revolutions in transportation and communication made possible a rapacious, unsustainable exploitation of what was, after all, a limited resource. Hunters interested in passenger pigeons for market or sport, along with families and sometimes whole communities, would congregate under the colonies with traps, nets, poles, firearms and whatever else would further the slaughter. The scale of violence entailed in these large-scale “harvesting” operations remains shocking, even to those well-versed in the blood-soaked history of the Euro-American advance across the continent. Even more tragically, the nestlings were highly desired by hunters for their tender meat. This selective targeting decimated successive generations of squabs and contributed greatly to the subsequent population crash. McLean County resident E.L. Rodman remembered “wild pigeons beyond number” in the 1850s and 1860s. He said that Thomas Bolby, who lived in Old Town Township east of Bloomington, would use a “stool pigeon” [or decoy] and net thousands of birds at a time. “He would take them to Bloomington by half-wagon box loads and I think that one load would have been sufficient to supply one [bird] to each person in the town, for it was not a large place then,” noted Rodman in a 1922 reminiscence. As if this wanton slaughter wasn’t enough, hundreds of thousands of pigeons were taken captive so sportsmen could organize shooting contests using live birds. “A pigeon shoot will come off LeRoy Friday this week,” reported the Apr. 20, 1875 Pantagraph. “Five hundred wild pigeons have been secured, and a good time may be expected. Lovers of the sport are invited.” In early October of that same year, the Bloomington Shooting Club received 2,000 live passenger pigeons for a two-day program at the old west side fairgrounds. The carnage included “world-renowned exhibition shot” Adam H. Bogardus killing fifty birds in eight minutes, all the while loading his own gun. “This will be by far the largest shooting tournament in Illinois this year,” boasted The Pantagraph, “and nearly all the best shots in the West will participate.” The slaughter in Illinois continued into the 1880s, at least in the larger forested sections of the state where the bird could still be found in sufficient numbers. “Hunters report immense quantities of wild pigeons around Havana [Ill.],” noted the March 15, 1882 Pantagraph. “One man got 900 in one day, and killed as high as twenty at a single shot.” By the mid-1890s, the days when the millions upon millions of passenger pigeons passed through Illinois were gone, never to return. “Wild pigeons are rapidly becoming extinct in this country,” reported the Nov. 13, 1895 Pantagraph. “They made biennial visits to this locality several years ago in large numbers, but have been decreasing in numbers each year of late until very few of these birds are ever seen here now.” Twenty short years later wild pigeons had disappeared from not only Illinois but from the entire North American continent as well. “Martha,” the last known passenger pigeon, died at the Cincinnati Zoo on Sept. 1, 1914. “From billions to none in less than a century,” it was said of this appalling tragedy. There are passenger pigeon taxidermy mounts and specimens in universities, museum and various research institutions in the U.S. and elsewhere. The John Wesley Powell-Dale Birkenholz Natural History Collections at Illinois State University include three “stuffed” pigeons, two of which are mounted. The third, a “study skin,” is dated May 26, 1877, and originated from Warsaw, Ill., a Hancock County community along the Mississippi River. The two mounted pigeons came from R.H. Holder, a Bloomington resident and amateur ornithologist. Back in the fall of 1914, word of Martha’s passing was cause for somber reflection among some in Central Illinois. “There is a touch of sadness in this announcement to those who still remember the millions of these beautiful birds that used to sweep in migratory flight across this country,” reflected The Pantagraph. “Every man who was a boy in those days can still picture to himself the long extended and graceful lines in which they moved, column after column, for hours and even days.”",

    "content": "Although it hasn’t served as a Bloomington Fire Department station for well over seven decades, old Engine House No. 4 on South Main Street is still standing and, all things considered, not looking too bad. The old firehouse has survived all these years as home to a series of small businesses, some successful and others not so much. Yet its years as a BFD engine house, from 1903 until its closing around 1941, tells us plenty about Bloomington’s rich history. Most remarkably, it was in the early 1920s that a dispute over the fate of this firehouse led to a change in Bloomington’s form of municipal government! The story begins on the night of June 19-20, 1900, when 45 buildings and 4½ blocks of downtown, including the 1868 courthouse, were lost in what is now called the Great Bloomington Fire. It took a disaster of this size and scope for city leaders to get serious, dollar-wise, about fire protection. A joint committee charged with upgrading the fire department recommended the construction of a modern, centrally located headquarters station and several outlying, or neighborhood, engine houses. The city floated a $34,000 bond issue (or the equivalent of nearly $900,000 today, adjusted for inflation) to pay for the expansion project. Central Fire Station, located on the 200 block of East Front Street, opened November 1902. This old firehouse is now home to the foodie favorite Epiphany Farms Restaurant. Completed four months later, in March 1903, were two smaller engine houses, No. 3 on the 800 block of North Center Street, and No. 4 at 914 S. Main St. All three firehouses were designed by George H. Miller, one of the most influential architects in Bloomington history. The two outlying engine houses were likely identical or a mirror-image of each other, though No. 3 was torn down a long time ago. The first firemen assigned to Engine House No. 4, according to The Pantagraph, included Capt. Patrick Twoomey, Joe Burt and Albert Radbourn (the latter was brother of fellow Bloomington firefighter John Radbourn and future National Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Charles “Old Hoss” Radbourn). It’s likely the neoclassic brick engine house trimmed in brick and stone once featured a bell tower, though it’s not known when it was taken down. The building has also lost one of two bay doors that opened onto Main Street. Surviving decorative elements of the purposefully utilitarian building include a second story arched window. Engine House No. 4 opened more than 20 years before the first viaduct (or bridge) spanned the two east-west rail lines running through the warehouse district south of downtown. The new station thus brought peace of mind to many residents of South Hill, the heavily German neighborhood south of downtown, who worried that freight and passenger trains were blocking grade crossings and thus slowing the fire department’s response time to alarms on the city’s south side. Yet less than two decades after opening, with the fire department converting its horse-drawn wagons to motorized fire trucks, the future of Engine House No. 4 looked bleak. By the early 1920s, BFD Chief Henry Mayer maintained that “motorization” of the department made neighborhood fire stations, in a community as geographically compact as Bloomington (this was well before today’s unchecked eastside sprawl), increasingly redundant. Accordingly, on May 1, 1920, the city shuttered Engine House No. 4, just as the department’s few remaining horses were put out to pasture at Miller Park. With this decision a large number of south siders began grumbling that the loss of the South Main Street fire station left their side of town at risk. On July 8, 1921, for instance, a residential garage at 704 S. Center St. burned down after fire department equipment and personnel were held up for several minutes at the Center Street grade crossing by a Big Four Railroad train. “The south side people are beginning to feel that their properties are endangered unnecessarily by reason of the fact that they are without a firehouse,” noted The Pantagraph. “They say on other occasions, the department has been held up by trains, and that the practice is getting a bit wearisome.” As a result, a committee representing 200 South Hill petitioners called for the reopening of their neighborhood firehouse, at least until a South Main Street viaduct could be built over the Big Four and Lake Erie and Western Railroad tracks. At the July 22, 1921 city council meeting, Fire Chief Mayer argued for keeping the south side firehouse closed and in its stead installing a “block signal system.” Under such a setup, fire alarms in the city’s south end would automatically trigger trackside red lights alerting train crews to keep open key grade crossings south of downtown. Supporters of the south side firehouse remained so unhappy with city officials that they successfully circulated a petition to change the commission form of city government (which had been in effect for eight years) back to the more traditional aldermanic type. There was a growing sentiment among residents from working class and ethnic Irish and German areas northwest, west, and south of downtown that their interests were neglected under the newer form of government. They believed it placed a premium on nonpartisan, technocratic governance at the expense of shoe-leather politics and ward-level patronage better suited to meet the unique needs of each neighborhood. Consequently, the loss of the south side fire station became a rallying cry for those who wanted a return to a more politically engaged and grassroots-style city government. On July 11, 1922, by a 57 to 43 percent margin, city residents voted to return to the previous form of government that placed a premium on retail politicking. It took a few years, but continued pressure by South Hill residents to re-staff Engine House No. 4, at least until completion of the South Main Street viaduct, finally paid off. To much fanfare, the south side firehouse opened once again on Sept. 2, 1924. And even after the South Main Street viaduct welcomed public traffic for the first time on Dec. 13, 1925, Engine House No. 4 stayed open another fifteen or so years, remaining all that time the city’s only neighborhood fire station. The south side station closed for good as a firehouse around 1941, and over the years it has seen more than a dozen businesses come and go. Since the 1980s, for example, it has been home to Raymond D. Fairchild Jr.’s various enterprises, such as Fairchild’s Hubcap, Tires and Wheels, as well as Frank Wright’s many ventures, including Wright’s Painting & Window Cleaning Co. and AAA Wright’s Small Engine Repair Shop. Despite the many changes over the years, the building remains recognizable as a firehouse. Most unmistakable is the original “No. 4” still visible over the front door.",

    "content": "“Let the slogan of the day be, ‘Ride for Charity,’” announced the Jul. 6, 1911 Pantagraph. “Leave the automobile un-cranked and keep the horse in the barn, for the streetcar needs you.” What the streetcars needed on this summer day more than a century ago were lots of riders, preferably those of generous spirit with plenty of extra change jingling in pocketbook or purse. Why’s that? Well, off and on, beginning in the 1890s and continuing for about two decades, the Bloomington-Normal streetcar system played host to an annual Trolley Day fundraiser. Organized by philanthropically minded upper-middle and upper-class society women, these charity events involved devoting a day’s worth of streetcar fares to the local benevolent association, which provided needed assistance to the most destitute of the city’s residents. “Everybody who rides will contribute to the fund to be dispersed in aiding the worthy poor during the long, cold winter,” reported The Pantagraph on the Sep. 26, 1899 Trolley Day. “This being the fact, all should ride, and ride early and often.” To boost ridership on Trolley Day, the streetcar conductors were replaced with young society women ranging in age from the late teens to the early twenties. These ladies then collected fares and used their wily charms to wheedle additional change from passengers. “It will be a novelty to ride on the cars which are in charge of young and pretty girls,” noted The Pantagraph in the typical patronizing, patriarchal language of the day. “Four to each car every hour in the day, with a chaperone to see that they do not get into mischief!” Local streetcars date to 1867 and the establishment of the Bloomington and Normal Horse Railway. Electric-powered trolleys arrived in 1890, and by mid-1920s, the local system included 8 lines and 22 cars connecting not only downtown Bloomington with Uptown Normal, but neighborhoods radiating out from these two commercial centers. Sometimes Normal community leaders would join the Bloomington effort, and on other occasions they would go their own way. On Saturday, Dec. 17, 1898, for instance, Normal held a Trolley Day exclusively for town library’s reading room. The day’s haul was $122, half of which went to the library. Although $61 doesn’t seem like such a great windfall nowadays, adjusted for inflation that total would’ve been the equivalent of $1,800 in 2017 dollars. “The handsome young lady conductors let no man escape,” reported The Pantagraph of Normal’s 1898 Trolley Day. Even William Irvin, the superintendant of the local street railway company, “was approached by one of the pretty collectors who didn’t know him from anyone else.” The good-humored Irvin, “forced to dig up 5 cents … remarked to a bystander that it was the first time he had been called on to pay for a streetcar ride in Bloomington in 18 years!” At the time, local charitable work was most often segregated by race and class. The society women who organized Trolley Days, for instance, were all white and mostly from upper-income east side households. “The poor we have always with us,” noted the Sep. 25, 1899, Pantagraph, on the eve of that year’s Trolley Day, “and while the times are more prosperous than they have been before there will be large demands on charity for worthy unfortunates, and money is needed to prevent suffering.” For $10, businessmen and society ladies could charter their own streetcar and hold a “private trolley party.” One decorated car was set aside for a special run to the east side fairgrounds, with riders paying $5 a seat. The who’s who of Twin City attorneys, physicians, bankers, manufacturers, and merchants purchasing a ticket for this car included Adlai E. Stevenson I, Judge Lawrence Weldon, T.J. Bunn, Wolf Griesheim and B.F. Hoopes. Trolley Days often included activities at Miller Park, a natural fit since one of the streetcar lines ran to the city’s largest “pleasure grounds.” For the Sep. 26, 1899, Trolley Day, there was free fishing at the lagoon (the larger lake was not constructed and opened until 1902), and a free evening band concert. On the other side of town, at the old east side fairgrounds, the Trolley Day schedule included a bicycle race and a friendly baseball game between “men of medicine” (local doctors) and “legal lights” (attorneys). This fair site is now the residential area bordered by Country Club Place, Vale Street, and Oakland and Mercer avenues. The Tuesday, Sep. 15, 1908, Trolley Day included a tag sale, with “pretty girls” fanning out through downtown and on the streetcars selling little cardboard “tags” (or buttons) with “Charity” emblazoned in red. “Tags cost anything from a cent up, chiefly up,” it was said, “but many young men filled their pockets with pennies and handed a penny out to every girl who asked him to buy.” The day’s receipts totaled nearly $1,300, or the inflation-adjusted equivalent of more than $35,000 today. The Jul. 6, 1911 Trolley Day, likely the last one in Bloomington-Normal, featured 160 or so “conductors” wearing white dresses adorned with gaily colored ribbons. “It was hard to resist the alluring glances of the pretty girls as they presided over the money boxes, and most of the travelers did not attempt to resist” remarked The Pantagraph. The fundraising total that day came to about $700, as the afternoon’s heavy rain put a damper on the festivities, including the boat rides at Miller Park, and the sale of ice cream, cake and lemonade at Franklin Park. Fares from the Normal loop car, about $40, went to the Baby Fold, the orphanage and child social service agency in Normal. That car was decorated in baby pictures, and the young conductors handed out colored cards with photographs of infants. It appears that further Trolley Days were not held in Bloomington-Normal after 1911, though just why is not known. Such fundraisers, however, continued in Champaign-Urbana and elsewhere, at least for a little while. The increasing popularity of the automobile doomed streetcar systems across the land. Locally, the era when picturesque trolley cars trundled down Twin City streets came to an end in mid-December 1936.",

    "content": "Bloomington-Normal’s ties to the national pastime are long and deep. Most famously, National Baseball Hall of Fame inductees Charles “Old Hoss” Radbourn and Clark Griffith were raised in the Twin Cities. Although these two larger-than-life characters garner the most attention, other local figures made a substantial mark on the game—at the plate, on the field and even managing from the dugout. One such talent was Frank “Pop” Dillon of Normal, who appeared in 312 Major League Baseball (MLB) games over five seasons, seeing the most action in 1901 and 1902 as a first baseman with the Detroit Tigers. The Normal boy then made a bigger name for himself in Los Angeles as a player-manager for the Angels of the Pacific Coast League, which at the time was becoming one of the preeminent minor leagues in North America (Major League Baseball did not come to California until 1958 when the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants relocated to LA and San Francisco respectively.) “Dillon was in fact among the top names in California baseball during the first two decades of the 20th century,” notes Brian McKenna in a biographical sketch for the Society for American Baseball Research. “He was a hard hitter and one of the top fielding first baseman on the coast.” Not only that, but the Normal native skippered the LA club to four league pennants. Unlike many early ballplayers, Dillon, who was born in Normal on Oct. 17, 1873, did not come from hardscrabble circumstances. Frank’s father, Levi Dillon, was a prominent Normal businessman who partnered with an uncle and nephew to become a leading importer, breeder, and seller of French draft horses. Normal and the surrounding McLean County countryside became a national center for the “Norman” horse trade thanks in great measure to the Dillon family’s pioneering work in the business. If a love of horses ran in the Dillon bloodline, so too did baseball. Frank Dillon’s mother, Mary Wright Dillon, was the sister of Sarah Wright Griffith. Sometime in the early 1880s, a widowed Sarah relocated her family, including her adolescent son Clark, from Missouri to Normal, where she would come to run a boarding house and do washing for university students. That made Frank Dillon and future hall of famer Clark Griffith cousins, born four years apart. Today, “The Old Fox,” as Griffith would become known, is regarded as a seminal figure in the game’s history. After a stellar career pitching for the National League Chicago Colts and Orphans (two early nicknames of the Cubs), Griffith became a principal founder the American League, the first manager of the Chicago White Sox franchise, and the longtime manger and owner of the Washington Senators. While his older cousin Clark made a name for himself in the big leagues, Frank Dillon attended the University Wisconsin, playing baseball and maybe some football as well. It appears he graduated in 1896, but by that time had lost his amateur status because he was already playing professional baseball. Dillon spent most of his minor league career in the Western Association. In 1894, he played part of the year with the Peoria Distillers and part with the Des Moines Prohibitionists! At this time, after finishing a season in the minor leagues, Dillon would return to Bloomington-Normal to play for various local “nines” into late autumn. In September 1895, for instance, he helped Chenoa defeat a visiting club from Pontiac by a score of 9 to 7. “An immense crowd witnessed the game,” reported The Pantagraph, “and the cheering at several stages … was simply deafening.” In 1896, during the baseball offseason, Dillon began teaching physical education part-time at Illinois State Normal University. He’s even credited with coaching the first women’s basketball team in school history. It was also at ISNU that he met his wife, Freeport native Blanche Ada Reitzell. In early Sept. 1899, Dillon, then toiling for Buffalo, N.Y. of the Western League, was sold to MLB’s Pittsburgh Pirates for $1,500. With a month left in the big league season, he became the Pirates everyday first baseman, batting .256 in 129 plate appearances. Dillon then played for the Detroit Tigers during the first two seasons of the newly organized American League, 1901 and 1902. One of Dillon’s claims to fame was becoming the first American Leaguer to hit four doubles in a nine-inning game. Remarkably, he accomplished the feat on April 25, 1901, in Detroit’s very first game in the inaugural A.L. season! Two of his four doubles were hit in a furious ten-run, bottom-of-the-ninth-inning rally against Milwaukee. Dillon’s last two-bagger scored the tying and winning runs, and for his heroics with the bat his teammates carried him off the field. No one in the American League would smack four doubles in a single game again until Billy Werber of Boston did it during the 1935 season. After two years in Detroit, Dillon headed West to play for the minor league Los Angeles Angels, quickly becoming one of the California League’s best hitters (the Angels would join the Pacific Coast League the following season.) In early 1904, Dillon, who was readying for a third season in LA, found himself at the center of a bitter contract dispute between Angels owner James F. Morley and Major League Baseball. He ended up being shipped to Brooklyn that year and appearing in 135 games for MLB’s Superbas (as the club was called before becoming the Dodgers). In the spring of 1905, Morely coughed up $1,700 (equal to about $48,000 today, adjusted for inflation) to bring Dillon back to LA. Reports at the time said it was “the biggest price ever paid by a minor league club for the purchase of a big league player.” Dillon remained in LA, playing for and managing the Angels for another decade. He eventually earned the nickname “Pop,” partly because of his long tenure as Angeles manager, and partly because his hair prematurely turned gray in his 20s. As a player-manager, Dillon was LA’s regular first baseman through the 1912 season, and he was still getting into an occasional game during his final year as the club’s manager, which came in 1915. After baseball, Frank and Blanche Dillon bought and managed an apple farm in Yucaipa, Cal. They eventually made their way back to Los Angeles, running a bakery known for its delicious pies. So although we can’t speak about hot dogs, Dillon’s all-American life directly involved baseball and apple pie. “The gray-thatched veteran who was beloved by old-time Los Angeles fans for his fighting tactics on the diamond, is fighting now against big odds and little hope is held out for his recovery from the malady from which he has been suffering for several years,” reported The Los Angeles Times shortly before Pop Dillon’s death on Sept. 12, 1931, at the age of 57.",

    "content": "Football, it’s been clear for several decades now, is the national pastime, having assumed the mantle long held by that most American of games—baseball. An aging, shrinking Major League Baseball fan base means that most playoff games nowadays attract smaller television audiences than ho-hum regular season National Football League contests. Simply and sadly put, even the “Fall Classic”—as the World Series is known—is in danger of becoming culturally irrelevant, certainly on a national level. Such was not always the case. From Oct. 2 to Oct. 10, 1926—93 years ago—the nation’s attention turned to the World Series between the National League champion St. Louis Cardinals and their American League counterparts, the New York Yankees. Robert Arthur “Bob” O’Farrell, the Cardinals catcher and N.L. MVP that year, would later serve one season (1938) as manager of the minor league Bloomington Bloomers. Back in early Oct. 1926, area residents could purchase a World Series-special $4 round trip ticket between Bloomington and St. Louis on the Illinois Traction System, an “interurban” electric rail line that once connected many Central Illinois communities ($4 in the fall of 1926 would be the equivalent of more than $58 today, adjusted for inflation.) Of course, few local residents made it down to St. Louis to watch a game in person. Let it be said, though, that Frank Steiner, a Chicago & Alton Railroad flagman from Bloomington, used a week off to attend one or more games in the Bronx! The 1926 World Series was also held before the rise and ubiquity of radio, and its transformative role reshaping American society and popular culture in the following decade. Even so, there was an exciting way for local fans to follow the nail-biting action in real-time—pitch by pitch, inning by inning. At this time, daily papers and other news outlets made use of what were known as magnetic or electronic “player boards” to create a rough facsimile of the real action taking place at faraway big league ballparks. In The Pantagraph’s case, this commercially manufactured mechanical device—roughly the size a small movie screen—was installed on the newspaper’s south wall, facing the 300 block of W. Washington St. During games, the play-by-play, which at the time arrived by telegraph, was then relayed to a team of board operators who skillfully manipulated a steel ball, “bat” and other moving pieces over a diagram of a baseball field. An announcer, carried via loudspeaker, would supplement the action. Surrounding the “field” were the updated line score and lineups, similar to what one would find on a Major League park scoreboard. “An expert announcer and a corps of experienced operators promise you good service,” stated The Pantagraph of its “big electric player board.” The Cardinals, after dropping Games 4 and 5 in St. Louis (Babe Ruth hit a World Series record three home runs in Game 4), found themselves trailing 3 games to 2 as they headed back to New York. They would need to win the final two games in the best-of-seven series to be crowned World Series champions. In Game 6, held Sat, Oct. 9, future Hall of Fame right-hander Grover Cleveland Alexander of St. Louis—one of the greatest pitchers in baseball history—earned his second complete-game victory of the series as the Cards dispatched the Yanks 10-2. Thus the 1926 World Series came down to a winner-take-all Game 7 in the Bronx. In Bloomington, the Sunday afternoon finale attracted an overflow crowd that spilled onto Madison Street. Interurban cars trundling down Madison Street had to slow to a crawl to navigate the multitude. A large group of younger fans kept tabs on the game from the roof of C.W. Frey’s garage. It was called the largest crowd in city history to “witness” a World Series game. “At times the cheering was so loud that the operators on the board had difficulty in hearing the announcer,” observed The Pantagraph, “but so perfectly did The Pantagraph’s big board reproduce each play that the spectators had no difficulty in following the progress of the game.” Meanwhile, back in the Bronx, in the bottom of the seventh inning, New York second baseman Tony Lazzeri stepped up to the plate with the bases loaded. With St. Louis clinging to a 3-2 lead, Cardinals skipper Rogers Hornsby called for Alexander—who had pitched nine hard innings the day before—to relieve starting pitcher Jesse Haines. The story goes that Alexander, whose demons included alcohol, had “tied one on” the night before and was fast asleep bullpen. Be that as it may, “Old Pete” (as Alexander was known) roused himself sufficiently to get Lazzeri—a future Hall of Famer in his own right—to strike out swinging. “Can you imagine yourself at this kind of ball game?” one radio announcer wondered aloud in amazement as the two big league stars faced off with the whole shebang on the line. Two innings later, in the bottom of the ninth, with St. Louis still up 3-2 and needing only one more out, Alexander walked Babe Ruth (who back in the third inning had hit his fourth homerun of the series.) With Ruth on first base, the Yankees leftfielder Bob Meusel stepped into the batter’s box. Then, with all eyes on Meusel and Alexander into his windup, Ruth unexpectedly bolted for second. Yes, you read that right: The Babe was attempting to steal second base with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning, in a World Series Game 7, and his team trailing by one run! Despite his somewhat portly physique, Ruth was a surprisingly decent base runner. But on this Sunday afternoon, the Baseball Gods frowned on this brazenly impulsive act. Cardinals catcher Bob O’Farrell fired the ball to second base and “the Great Bambino” was tagged out—it wasn’t even close!—and just like that World Series was over and the Cardinals were world champions. In spring of 1938, after his big league playing days were behind him, Cards backstop Bob O’Farrell settled in Bloomington to pilot the Bloomers for one season in the Illinois-Indiana-Iowa League. O’Farrell, who grew up in Waukegan, Ill., was no stranger to the “Three-I” League. Two decades earlier, he played most of two seasons (1916 and 1917) for the Peoria Distillers. The former Cardinals catcher and his famed battery mate, Grover Cleveland Alexander, were reunited in Bloomington when “Old Pete” brought his semi-pro Empires of Springfield, Ill. to Fans Field for a preseason exhibition game (see accompanying photograph.) O’Farrell had a frustrating year in Bloomington, as the Bloomers—playing before a smattering of fans on most days—finished seventh in the eight-team Illinois-Indiana-Iowa League. The following season, 1939, would prove to be the last for Bloomington in the storied Class B circuit. “You know, I wondered why Ruth tried to steal second then,” O’Farrell recalled long after the 1926 World Series. “A year or two later I went on a barnstorming trip with the Babe and I asked him. Ruth said he thought ‘Alex’ (Grover Cleveland Alexander) had forgotten he was there. Also that the way Alex was pitching they’d never get two hits in a row off him, so he better get in position to score if they got one. Well, maybe that was good thinking and maybe not. In any case, I had him out a mile at second.”",

    "content": "The start of 1946-1947 school year, coming as it did a full year after the end of World War II, was a sign of the nation’s halting return to normalcy. Yet the enormity of the global conflagration meant that prewar routine, however defined, wasn’t coming back anytime soon. For instance, in the fall of 1946, with the two local universities bursting at the seams with returning military veterans, prefabricated barracks used to house prisoners of war were brought in to serve as temporary housing. On the other hand, enrollments were relatively steady when it came to area elementary, middle and high schools. There were 2,944 grade school and junior high students in Bloomington’s public school system, and 1,084 in the high school, for a district-wide enrollment of 4,028, a figure relatively unchanged from the previous school year’s total of 3,989. At this time, Bloomington Public Schools included Bloomington High and ten neighborhood schools—Bent, Edwards, Emerson, Franklin, Irving, Jefferson, Lincoln, Raymond, Sheridan and Washington. Although the city was much more compact, area-wise, in 1946 than it is today, the large number of schools meant elementary age children could walk to school no mater where they lived in the city. The war’s impact though, was felt elsewhere. There remained a scarcity of consumer goods, to cite one representative example of the many lingering effects of the ration economy. Children’s clothes were still hard to find, especially those modestly priced. The Pantagraph reported that in the weeks leading up to the start of school, mothers throughout the area were busy sewing clothes for their children. One such mother was Eva Okell, who lived with her husband Robert and their family on Harwood Place in Bloomington. She sewed all her second-grade daughter Barbara’s school attire except for coats and leggings. She made skirts from both a pair of men’s wool trousers and “her own outmoded clothes,” saving upwards of $3 on “every homemade garment.” In 1946, there were still plenty of rural, one-room schools out in the McLean County countryside, though their days were numbered, thanks in large part to the graveling of many township roads and the increased reliability and safety of school buses. There were 24 fewer rural schools in the county to start the 1946 school year than the year before, with 10 of those closing due to consolidations in the Stanford area and West Township. Others shuttered due to declining enrollments. That left 158 rural schools in the county in the fall of 1946, down from 182 the year before. The great wave of school consolidation would come two years later, in 1948, leading to the abrupt closure of the majority of McLean County’s rural schools. The county’s last remaining one-room schools, both located in Dale Township, closed after the 1959-1960 school year. This being the Twin Cities, back to school also means back to college, and 1946 was no different. Returning veterans flocked to the two local universities, due in great measure to the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, known popularly as the G.I. Bill. This led to acute shortages in on- and off-campus housing. For its part, Illinois Wesleyan University placed an advertisement in The Pantagraph desperately seeking rented rooms with the hope of relieving the housing shortage facing the “largest student body” in school history. By late August, IWU had capped enrollment at 950 students. Of those, around 480, or slightly more than half, were veterans under the G.I. Bill. The freshmen class alone included more than 180 servicemen and at least 4 servicewomen. Relief came in the form of the aforementioned prefabricated army barracks, which in IWU’s case were shipped from a former prisoner-of-war camp in Weingarten, Mo. There was irony in housing university enrolled veterans in POW barracks, but what exactly was ironic about it no one quite knew! The housing units included four main barracks, 100 feet long and 20 feet wide, which were then divided up into rooms. Even so, additional trailers had to be moved on or close to campus to house more students. The university also acquired two North Main Street residences and repurposed them as dormitories, renaming the old homes DeMotte Lodge and Munsell Hall. There was an even tighter squeeze at Illinois State Normal University, despite the conservative admission policies advocated by President R.W. Fairchild. In the fall of 1946, enrollment topped 1,800, with 635 of those veterans. When school opened the second week of September, Fairchild had to tell some 100 veterans that they could not bring their families to campus as previously planned because the POW barracks erected on the University Farm wouldn’t be ready until October, at the earliest. Anywhere from 50 to 90 men were then temporarily housed in the Cook Hall gymnasium (see accompanying photograph), where they slept on wooden double bunks. ISNU’s POW barracks were located at the south end of the University Farm off Sudduth Road (now College Avenue), and were open to married and single students. By the spring of 1947 there were nearly 250 men, women and children making a home in what would soon take the name Cardinal Court (the university would open a new and permanent Cardinal Court along Gregory Street in 1959; the old WW II barracks were razed in 1962). Clearly, as evident by the growing number and size of families at Cardinal Court, veterans were busy with more than schoolwork. All this baby-making, of course, led to the baby boom generation and a sustained enrollment surge that got underway two decades later. ISNU’s first baby boom class enrolled as freshmen in the fall of 1964. On the elementary school level, in late August 1946, teacher Lucille Murphy was preparing for her 25th year in the classroom. A Normal resident, she taught at Little Brick School, which was on West Washington Street well outside Bloomington city limits. From 1927 to 1941, Little Brick was one of several area one-room schools that served as real-world laboratories for ISNU faculty and students. Murphy began her teaching career at Ireland Grove School, and put in 15 years at Little Red School (not to be confused with Little Brick!), located on Linden Street in north Normal. Murray didn’t drive an automobile, so she always walked to and from school, which meant hoofing it upwards of five miles a day, depending on where she was teaching. In 1946, she lived on the 300 block of Virginia Avenue, and so rode the city bus to Euclid and Grove streets on Bloomington’s western edge, and then walked the rest of the way to Little Red School. For the 1946-1947 school year, she taught a combined first-through-fourth grade class of 20 boys and girls.",

    "content": "On Sept. 25, 1857, John Houseman, a German immigrant “deranged for some months,” committed suicide by hanging himself at the McLean County jail. “Self destruction” was the coroner’s jury verdict. Such a scene was all-too common, not only in McLean County but in a great many of the jails and prisons throughout the nation. The American penal system has long failed to protect its most vulnerable populations, especially the mentally ill. When James Swaim retired in November 1902 after serving twenty years as the county’s “turnkey,” he reflected on the risk mentally ill inmates represented to themselves and to others. “The most dangerous prisoners,” he said, “were not the murderers, horse thieves or other criminals, but the insane.” For every successful suicide there were many more unsuccessful attempts. In the summer of 1903, Hattie Watt, a “feeble-minded girl aged nineteen years,” was charged with insanity and placed in the county jail. On Aug. 15, she tore her night dress into strips and tied them together to make a rope some eight feet long. She placed one end tightly around her neck and was about to throw the other end over a two-by-four joist in the ceiling when a night jailer, alerted to her locked room by suspicious sounds, halted the effort. This attempted suicide occurred in the county’s fifth jail (see accompanying image), located at the corner of Madison and Monroe streets on the western edge of downtown. Many longtime residents will remember this jail, which served has the county lockup for 95 years, from 1882 to 1977. In the fall of 1915, Annie Henrichsen, inspector for the State Charities Commission, paid a visit to the McLean County jail. At the time, Illinois sheriffs were reimbursed a set amount for each prisoner under their charge, with the rate set by the respective county government. Henrichsen noted McLean County paid about the lowest rate in all the state, a reflection of the county’s longstanding reputation for parsimony. In March 1955, the U.S. Bureau of Prisons issued a report on a recent inspection of the county jail. Inspector Roy J. Guenzel found conditions deplorable, especially when it came to sanitation. Prisoners had to make use of two decrepit toilets and wash basins in the main cell block. Individual cells did not have running water, so open chamber pots were used during the night. The jail, according to the report, was also infested with rats, prompting the inspector to call for much of the interior to be gutted and rebuilt. Many on the McLean County Board of Supervisors took umbrage to the findings. “It seems to me things are in pretty good shape at the jail,” was the response of Clyde Hunter, the board’s public buildings chairman. In late September 1959, a jailed 15-year-old, charged with truancy and car theft, committed suicide using a shirt tied around a steel bar. In its final years, conditions in the county jail deteriorated further. In March 1970, The Pantagraph published a letter from a Bloomington resident who four days earlier had spent a brief stint in jail. He was placed in the “holdover” area equipped with little more than a few hammocks, though since the chains holding them were broken, they proved useless. “If a person wants a drink of water, he has to drink from the bathtub which has scum on it a foot thick,” he wrote. “There are water bugs and roaches big enough to ride on. The officers were truly nice and courteous but it is a shame even for them to spend a workday in a place like that.” On March 1, 1977, the crumbling, rotting 95-year-old jail finally gave way to the current one, which is located immediately to the south of the Law and Justice Center. “It is hard to believe this place was designed for men,” noted Pantagraph reporter D. Wesley Smith, upon visiting the old jail a week after the last prisoners were transferred to the new one. Sheriff John King led Smith on a tour, showing off things such as the “black cell,” so-called because of its iron door and unlit room. There was also the closet-size “stand-up” cell. “There is room only to stand, barely to breathe” noted Smith. “Once the door is closed, there is nothing at all.” Although the new McLean County jail represented an immense improvement over its predecessor, the sheriff’s department has struggled to meet the needs of an ever greater number of mentally ill prisoners. County officials began tackling this intractable problem in earnest after the National Institute of Corrections issued a report several years ago critical of the county’s mental health system. The longstanding problem had clearly reached a tipping point to become a full-blown crisis. Over one nine month period, from January 2012 through September 2013 (to cite a representative example), jail staff put a stop to 34 suicide attempts. At the time, Sheriff Mike Emery said that on any given day around 25 percent of the inmate population had received treatment for mental illness. In 2015, the County Board released the Mental Health Action Plan, aimed at addressing the myriad of problems faced by the mentally ill, both in jail and out, from juvenile services to housing. A centerpiece of this reform effort is the $45 million, 80,000 square feet addition to the county jail. The addition will include a special needs unit to accommodate upwards of 48 prisoners, with 16 cells set aside for the seriously mentally ill. County residents should take heart that this concerted, well-funded effort is underway. It’s been a long time coming. In September 1871, Bloomington police officers arrested and fined a “crazy man named Thomas” on a charge of disorderly conduct at the west side depot. Unable to pay the $7.35 fine (or about $150 in today’s dollars, adjusted for inflation), Thomas was “lodged in the calaboose” (whether the city or county jail is not known). That was not the end of this story, though. “The bystanders at the depot, who witnessed the arrest,” reported The Pantagraph, “feeling indignant towards the policemen for beating and then arresting a simple insane man, yesterday subscribed the money to pay his fine and had him released.”",

    "content": "For Bloomington, the age of aviation arrived on September 14, 1910. On that date, a one-man airship known as the Comet sailed over the city, drawing astonished crowds wherever it passed. The Pantagraph hailed the flight as the first made by a “controllable aircraft” in Bloomington history. Lighter-than-air airships, which unlike hot air balloons are propelled and steered, actually date back to the 1780s when balloons were first fitted with rudimentary propulsion mechanisms such as hand-cranked propellers. A full-blown airship craze began in 1901 when Alberto Santos-Dumont piloted his small airborne craft from the Parc Saint Cloud west of Paris to the Eiffel Tower and back in less than thirty minutes, earning 100,000 francs in prize money for his effort. Santos-Dumont’s basic airship design was then copied by many adventure-seekers, promoters, tinkerers, and aviation buffs on both sides of the Atlantic, and soon these weird and wonderful lighter-than-air contraptions were plying the skies over European and American cities and towns. Nine years later, in 1910, Bloomington residents got to see such a flying machine up close and in person. The Business Men’s Association invited Capt. George E. Yager to the city so he could launch his airship, christened the Comet, twice a day for a week. Yager, an aviation showman from Omaha, also brought along mechanic J.T. Birmingham and “aeronaut” Horace B. Wild. The “dirigible balloon” (as it was called by The Pantagraph) was tethered at an open lot in the White Place development on what was then the city’s far northeast side. Technically, the Comet was a blimp, since it did not have a internal skeleton undergirding the fabric-enclosed cavity holding the lighter-than-air gas, like the ones made of aluminum alloy on the great behemoths built in the late 1920s and early 1930s (the Graf Zeppelin being the most famous of these). The far-smaller, one-person Comet was lifted into the air by means of a lemon-shaped “bag” holding 10,080 cubic feet of hydrogen gas. It measured 75 feet in length and 16 feet in diameter, and was made from 1,020 yards of varnished Japanese silk, “sewed in squares, as bricks are set in a wall, so that a seam could rip only for a distance.” Underneath the inflated gas envelope was a girder-like framework supporting a “whirring and buzzing” six-horsepower gasoline engine (see top accompanying image). The sixteen-foot diameter propeller was in the bow (or front) of the craft, and at cruising speed it made 250 revolutions per minute. The pilot pulled ropes to either side of him to control the the 5 x 6½ feet rudder, which was made of spruce and covered in French muslin. Taking the Comet aloft was risky business when the winds exceeded eight miles per hour, and it appears Yager and his crew pulled off just three recorded flybys during their Bloomington stopover. To the disappointment of many, the inaugural launches for Tuesday, September 13, were cancelled due to high winds. Although the winds had not subsided by the next day, the Business Men’s Association (worried, according to the local press, that “another postponement would subject them to much criticism if not ridicule”) pressured Yager to green light a launch. The promoter capitulated, and a crowd of around 2,000 curiosity seekers watched the Comet’s first takeoff from White Place. All long the route the airship and its pilot were greeted with “cheers and waving hands and handkerchiefs,” remarked The Pantagraph. “Seldom in the history of the city has a public amusement project created so universal interest.” The Comet sailed over the city before the pilot, no longer willing to risk the craft amid the strong northwesterly winds, cut short the initial jaunt and made an unscheduled landing at the corner of Robinson and Clay (today Oakland Ave.) streets. The following day brought more favorable flying conditions as the Comet journeyed to downtown Bloomington, a trip highlighted by a landing on the rooftop of C.W. Klemm’s, department store. “Circling above the Illinois Hotel,” observed The Pantagraph, “the big dirigible sailed over the row of buildings on the north side of the square and then, as gently as a bird, it dropped down to the roof.” With surrounding streets, the courthouse lawn and office building windows crowded with onlookers, the airship rested on the store roof for one half hour (see the bottom accompanying image) before lifting off and gliding toward the seven-story People’s Bank building at the corner of Center and Washington streets. The Comet then circled the courthouse dome and headed back toward White Place. Despite the efforts of Yager and many others, airships never lived up to their promise. In the 1920s, the U.S. Navy constructed massive dirigibles with the idea that they could serve as airborne aircraft carriers. Between 1925 and 1935, three of these enormous airships, including the USS Akron, were lost to deadly accidents. And most famously, the brief and colorful history of transatlantic passenger service came to an end in 1937 with the fiery explosion of the German-operated Hindenburg near Lakehurst, NJ. The story of the Comet’s 1910 visit has attracted the attention of organizers of the upcoming “Cogs and Corsets: A Steampunk Happening,” a weekend festival scheduled Friday, June 2 through Sunday, June 4, with events planned in and around downtown Bloomington. Not familiar with steampunk? Well, it’s an interactive fictional world which imagines steam powered inventions of the Victorian era to match modern technology. Adults (and sometimes whole families) dress the part and interact with likeminded enthusiasts who delve into a “future past that never was.” Participants to steampunk gatherings such as the one next weekend showcase their own whimsical, often intricate costumes and personas for what’s been described as an “anachronistic mix of science fiction, modern values and a sense of fun.” Steampunk fiction and art often feature city skies crowded with airships of all shapes and styles. Free activities for this “Steampunk Happening” include a Friday evening Tesla coil demonstration at Red Raccoon Games on North Main Street. On Saturday there will be a promenade of costumed participants and a display of steam tractors, both on the museum square. Events that require a paid ticket include a soiree and historic mansion tours. For more information, visit the Downtown Bloomington Association’s website. In January 1950, The Pantagraph revisited the exploits of the Comet forty years after it had sailed the skies over Bloomington. The now 72-year-old George Yager had given up the thrills of promoting powered flight in favor of a more sedentary life. The herald of an airship age that never came was now in the wicker furniture business in Omaha, Neb. Unfortunately, we’re not aware of any connection between steampunk and the wicker furniture business!",

    "content": "Back in the late 1800s, a fair number of Central Illinois residents found themselves in the wilds of Canada’s Yukon Territory panning and digging for gold. Not surprisingly, most returned from that unforgiving landscape a little poorer and a whole lot wiser to the ways of the wider world. The Klondike Gold Rush began in earnest during the summer of 1897. Fortune seekers flocked to a stretch of eastern Alaska and the Yukon where rich gold deposits were discovered a year earlier. Area residents were among the thousands upon thousands of would-be miners who risked life, limb and the family nest egg (often losing one or more in the process) to gold fever. In August 1898, George Lurshen of the DeWitt County community of Weldon returned from the Klondike having lost $1,000 (or the equivalent of more than $29,000 in inflation-adjusted 2017 dollars). “Mr. Lurshen comes back to his wife and little family with not much beyond a pair of strong arms and willing hands,” commented The Pantagraph. In a letter to George W. Stubblefield, local resident and Klondike prospector George E. Case provided a colorful portrait of the Yukon gold fields, where life was cheap in the extreme. Suicides were common, as were the drowning deaths of inexperienced miners navigating boats through the swift, choppy waters of the region’s glacial rivers and streams. Case recalled five miners lost in single day to the frigid waters of the White Horse River. “They seemed like people possessed of the devil and devoid of good sense,” he wrote of those who were killed foolishly running the rapids blind. To Case’s apparent surprise, there were a fair number of women in Dawson City, the great boomtown of the Yukon Gold Rush. “Most of them are dressed in a rather flashy manner,” he wrote in what was perhaps a veiled reference to prostitution. “One can get nearly everything if he can pay for it … most of the currency is gold dust, and one cannot do business without gold scales.” Even subtropical fruits such as oranges were available—for a price. He also noted the town was “full of idle men,” many of whom were failed miners dumbstruck by utter failure. Edward Johnson of Bloomington also returned from the gold fields in August 1898. Though he only made it as far as St. Michael, a community on the Alaskan coast, he did have some interesting observations for The Pantagraph. Sled dogs were everywhere, he said, adding that “when one dog barks every dog in the city sets up a howl; the combined effect being indescribable and alarmingly terrific.” Typhoid fever was a constant threat, and many miners suffered from scurvy. It was said that six months in the Alaskan and Yukon wilds would take more out of a man than ten years mining in the Colorado Rockies. “Not a man stays in the Klondike three months without being more or less broken in health,” continued Johnson’s observations, with “some miners returning with $50,000 of gold who would give all of it to get back the health they took with them.” Despite the harsh conditions and loss of life, the beckoning, glittering promises of the Klondike Gold Rush—both the wealth and high adventure—captured the imagination of the American public. In mid-October 1898, the touring theatrical production, “Heart of the Klondike,” came to the Grand Opera House in downtown Bloomington (see accompanying image). The Daily Bulletin, another Bloomington newspaper, called it “an extraordinary powerful and vivid reproduction of the scenery and life of that vast treasure house of the eternal ice king to which millions of longing eyes are turned.” In early November 1898, Robert L. Maxton of Saybrook recounted his experiences in the Great White North. Maxton, a veteran of the Black Hills gold rush three decades earlier, had left for the Klondike with other local adventurers. “He chased the golden will o’ the wisp for 5,000 miles, yet it appeared ever ahead, shadowy, yet attractive,” commented the Bulletin. After spending 50 days prospecting along the upper Copper River, Maxton concluded that whole region was a “fake so far as mining is concerned.” Gold was everywhere, but never in “paying quantities.” He believed that this latest gold rush was a “gigantic swindling scheme” perpetrated by the railroads and steamship lines to boost traffic and thus revenues. If anything, the future of the Klondike would entail grazing livestock during the summer months. Even a jaundiced Maxton, though, praised the country as a “wonderland of beauty.” One of the more remarkable Klondike stories was told by Bloomington-born Kate Rodenbach, whose father Herman Boeheim was a hired man for Judge David Davis. Orphaned at the age of 12, Kate became a “nurse girl” to a prominent family before leaving Bloomington and eventually marrying John Rodenbach, a brakeman for the Chicago & Alton Railroad. After his death in 1891, Kate worked as a Pullman car cleaner, among other tough jobs, before becoming a housekeeper to a sister and brother of Klondike millionaire Clarence Berry of Salem, Oregon. Rodenbach then traveled to Dawson City with Berry and his new bride. While Berry became one of the more successful miners and speculators of the Klondike, Rodenbach struck out on her own. She became a cook in a mining camp cook and then proprietor of a boarding house. “The miners used to come twenty miles in the freezing winter and ask me to bake for them,” she recalled. “I have been given $5 many a time for a loaf of hot bread.” At her hotel she cared for a Swedish miner (or so the story goes), whose frostbitten feet were crudely amputated. Before he died, Rodenbach promised to look after his daughter, who was in Sacramento. In exchange, the dying Swede handed over a deed to a claim on Hunker Creek. As fate would have it, the claim earned Rodenbach a tidy sum. After her wild and wooly Dawson City days, she settled in California with an estimated $60,000 or more to her name. “The woman who had to work early and late in a cheap lodging house at Los Angeles in the winter of ’94 and ’95,” The Pantagraph noted of Rodenbach, “lives nowadays at the most costly hotel in the state, has her private coach and coachman and orders her gowns from the most fashionable modistes in San Francisco and Los Angeles.” So despite the raft of failures, there was at least one local success story when it came to the pitiless Klondike. “I advise none but the most rugged and experienced miners to go into that horrible arctic region,” said the 37-year-old Rodenbach in December 1898. “The days for getting rich there suddenly have almost wholly gone.”",

    "content": "On July 3, 1894, area residents flocked to the Chicago & Alton Railroad on Bloomington’s west side. They came to support striking railway workers and to gawk at more than a dozen abandoned freight and passenger trains that had not moved since their crews walked off the job a few days earlier. The trains—still packed with passengers and freight!— were lined up at the rail yard adjacent to the C&A Shops complex, while others were strung out along sidings and the west side Union Depot. In an age when America moved by rail, the C&A train yard and depot were normally two of the busiest and most bustling places in all the Twin Cities. Instead of the cacophonous clamor of hissing steam and screeching metal, an eerie stillness fell over the west side. “Altogether it was the sight of a lifetime,” remarked The Pantagraph. The “great Alton tie-up,” as it became known, was the result of sympathy strikes for Pullman Palace Car Co. factory workers, who on May 11 staged a walkout at industrialist George Pullman’s company town south of Chicago. Beginning June 20, labor leader Eugene V. Debs and the American Railway Union (ARU) orchestrated a boycott of trains carrying Pullman rail cars. The strike then spread like prairie fire from Chicago, crippling railroad traffic throughout much of the Midwest and East Coast. Local railway workers were already upset with C&A management for firing two brakemen and a conductor. On Thursday, June 28, ARU organizer W.C. Lynch came to Bloomington with orders to “tie up” the Chicago & Alton Railroad. Crews then began abandoning their trains as they reached Bloomington, assisted by the ARU tactic of deploying striking workers and their supporters directly on rail lines to further bottle-up locomotives and rolling stock. Although the ARU didn’t have a particularly large presence in Bloomington, this industry-wide union received the support of the operating crafts, such as the Order of Railway Conductors, the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, and to a lesser extent the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen. By Friday, June 29, abandoned trains began piling up in the C&A yards. Three days later, on July 2, the administration of Democratic President Grover Cleveland (with Bloomington’s own Adlai E. Stevenson I as vice president) obtained a court injunction prohibiting the ARU from involving itself with the strike. Debs and other ARU leaders were eventually arrested, convicted and jailed. Cleveland then followed the injunction by dispatching armed troops to protect railroad property and get the trains running once more. Violence erupted in Chicago and elsewhere as striking workers and their supporters waged pitched battles with federalized troops, state militia and local law enforcement. Locally, the Pullman strike spread to other railroads. By July 3, Illinois Central freight traffic was coming to a standstill, with operations tied up in a Gordian knot to the north in Freeport and to the south in Clinton. Freight traffic had also come to a halt on the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway (popularly known as the “Big Four”), one of two east-west lines that passed through the warehouse district south of downtown Bloomington. Railroad agents worked with local commission merchants in a mad scramble to unload time-sensitive freight moldering in rail yards and along sidings. One major concern locally, especially olfactory wise, was a 20-car “meat train” carrying pork from the Fowler Packing Co. of Kansas City and destined for the East Coast and then Liverpool, England, by way of transatlantic steamer. At one point railroad officials were able to get these cars “re-iced,” and by the end of the strike only five of the twenty carloads of packed pork were lost to spoilage. On the evening of July 3, a massive crowd gathered at Union Depot and the yards complex. “There could not have been less than 4,000, and the Front Street and Locust bridges were jammed with people overlooking the scene,” noted The Pantagraph. “Bloomington never saw such a sight.” The tie-up left 14 Pullman cars and an estimated 1,000 passengers stuck in Bloomington. The chairman of the local ARU mediation committee walked through each stranded Pullman coach and sleeper to chat with passengers and determine who, if anyone, needed assistance. Flyers were distributed to these unfortunate rail passengers inviting them to local Fourth of July festivities planned for the old eastside fairground. Generally speaking, area residents were sympathetic to the striking railway workers, if for no other reason than the general mistrust and dislike many held for Gilded Age fat cats like George Pullman. “There is a strong current of feeling against great trusts and monopolies like the Pullman Company, who are endeavoring to preempt the earth and make slaves of the common people,” argued The Leader, a Bloomington newspaper which, like The Pantagraph, supported the Republican Party, though its politics were more progressive and reform-minded than its establishment competitor. “While nominally a strike against the Pullmans,” continued The Leader, “this industrial disturbance is simply a surface indication of the public wrath against the monstrous amassing of power in the hands of a few.” Sixty-five deputy U.S. marshals—“and they mean business,” observed The Pantagraph—played an instrumental role getting stuck trains moving again on Bloomington’s west side. They were led by U.S. Marshal W.B. Brinton of Tuscola, who was fresh from a contentious three-month United Mine Workers general strike that began in April. Brinton and a number of his deputies, unafraid to flex the “strong hand of Uncle Sam,” showed they meant business by first escorting a ten-car train out of the Twin Cities. “His deputies were everywhere and several times drove the crowd back from the engine,” reported The Pantagraph. “Catcalls, hisses, groans, derogatory remarks and curses filled the air, but away went the ten cars, including two of mail and baggage.” Locally, the strike’s back was broken on Saturday, July 7, when C&A Superintendent Willis Gray met with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen at James Costello’s saloon on the west side of the courthouse square. Afterward, both the engineers and firemen promptly announced that their grievances with the C&A were settled, and as such they were ready to return to work. The Bloomington Trades and Labor Assembly was quick to condemn the “treacherous” firemen and engineers for their “lack of brotherly feeling and good judgment.” By the evening of Sunday, July 8, rail traffic was back to its pre-strike schedules and rhythms. Although the Pullman Strike of 1894 was a deadly serious affair, there were times when a lighthearted observation was in order. Warned The Pantagraph during the height of the tie-up: “Two cars of beer for this city are sidetracked somewhere and the supply of some kinds is getting low. This news will affect different people very differently.”",

    "content": "African-American physician Eugene G. Covington came to Bloomington about 1900 to open a medical practice. This being thirty-five years after the end of the Civil War, one would think things were getting better for African Americans, at least in the North. Unfortunately that was not the case in Bloomington-Normal where black residents faced increased segregation and discrimination. By the 1890s, to cite several representative examples, African Americans could not stay at Bloomington hotels, and if they wanted to attend a local theater they had to sit in the back rows. And in 1908, Bloomington park commissioners decided to establish segregated beaches and changing rooms at Miller Park. The Springfield Race Riot of 1908 and a far bloodier “race war” in Chicago during the summer of 1919 cast a further pallor over any attempts to halt deteriorating race relations in Bloomington-Normal. In the early 1920s a resurgent Ku Klux Klan and its call for “pure Americanism” and white supremacy enjoyed wide support in McLean County. There were Klan parades in downtown Bloomington and rallies along Jersey Avenue. And by the 1920s downtown Bloomington restaurants began refusing service to African Americans. In addition to these humiliating and petty (and decidedly un-American!) discrimination and segregation practices, African Americans were barred from most professional employment opportunities. For example, black students could attend Illinois State Normal University and earn teaching degrees and certificates, but local public schools declined to hire them. Given this pervasive environment of fear and hate (how else should one describe it?), it’s not surprising that Covington was the only African-American doctor to work in McLean County until the 1930s. Born on Aug. 1, 1872, in Rappahannock County, Virginia, to former slave parents, Covington exhibited a sharp intellect from an early age. He eventually graduated from Howard University, a historically black school in the nation’s capital. In 1902, two years after Covington arrived in Bloomington, he married Alice Alena Lewis from the upstate New York community of Oswego. They eventually settled into a cozy residence at 410 E. Market St. and raised a family, with three boys surviving into adulthood. Covington expressed his frustration with the increasingly ugly racial climate in Bloomington-Normal with a lengthy guest column in the March 7, 1903, Pantagraph. In this essay, titled “The Race Question,” he took the opportunity to criticize a local member of the board of education for demanding that African Americans “do something to warrant and inspire respect.” Covington found such complaints disingenuous, given the pervasive discrimination faced by blacks. “We are told not to apply for positions as teachers,” he said by way of example. “And yet the gentleman says we must do something to merit respect.” In fact, Covington was acutely aware of the issue of respect, or rather the lack thereof. Both Eugene and Alice refused to attend the theater in Bloomington-Normal due to the humiliation of segregated seating arrangements. Although he earned a reputation for his civil rights advocacy, Covington was first and foremost a respected physician and surgeon. In addition to his family practice he was a member of the St. Joseph’s Hospital staff and had full privileges at Mennonite Hospital. St. Joseph’s admission records show that Covington treated mostly black patients for everything from “nervous prostration” to influenza. As a rule, a white physician had to be in attendance when Covington performed surgeries. Yet on occasion it appears as if Covington was the only physician in the operating room, as was the case in late February 1913 when he performed a successful appendectomy on a 23-year-old African-American. In February 1908, Covington complained to the McLean County Medical Society that some white doctors were undercharging African-American patients who could afford to pay the full standard rate of $2 for house calls. Covington said such undercutting put an undue burden on his practice, since the majority of his patients were black. The society agreed with Covington, calling undercharging “an infraction of professional honor.” During Covington’s lifetime African Americans were closely aligned with the Republican Party, given a legacy that included Abraham Lincoln, emancipation and the defense (at least until 1877) of political and civil rights for freed people in the post-Civil War Reconstruction Era. For most African Americans the switch to the Democratic Party came during the Great Depression and Franklin Roosevelt’s presidency. Back in the summer of 1908, Covington played a leading role organizing a parade and rally for Republican Richard Yates, Jr. and his bid for the party’s gubernatorial nomination. “A good-sized audience was present to hear the colored speakers,” reported The Pantagraph, “and not a few of the white voters of the city were in attendance.” Although the local Republican Party welcomed African-American support at the ballot box, by the early 20th century there was little interest in political and civil rights. Not only was the “Party of Lincoln” increasingly disinterested in racial equality, but loyal black Republicans faced discrimination within the party itself. Covington, for instance, was on the local Republican Party central committee in 1909, though he and two other African Americans were not allowed to sit on a regular ward committee but were relegated to an at-large (and all-black) committee. In early 1915, Covington was one of nearly 50 candidates who ran for four open city commissioner seats. His campaign slogan, “With malice towards none, goodwill to all,” was a nod to Lincoln’s second inaugural address. Covington was not one of the top four vote getters, but he did finish with a respectable middle-of-the-pack showing. Alice Covington passed away in 1925, and three years later Eugene married Amanda Thomas, a widow and longtime friend of the family. The marriage wasn’t a long one because Eugene died on February 3, 1929, after a short illness. He was only 56 years old and still practicing medicine. Eight years earlier, in May 1921, Covington participated in one of the periodic debates held by a group of local African-American pastors. The topic, “Resolved that the Negro should stay in the South for better advantages,” featured Covington arguing in the negative. For African Americans in the early 20th century, Central Illinois certainly offered brighter opportunities—socially, politically and economically—than the Deep South. That said, segregation of downtown Bloomington hotels, restaurants and theaters, as well as Miller Park beaches, continued into the 1960s. And major Twin City employers didn’t begin to hire black professionals until the late 1960s.",

    "content": "Ellen B. Ferguson, who made Bloomington-Normal her home in the 1870s, was a remarkable but ultimately inscrutable champion of women’s suffrage and feminist ideals. Born in Cambridge, England, Ferguson had a first-rate education, though whether formal or mostly informal is unknown. Her father, William Lombe Brooke, was a “lawyer of considerable reputation and social prominence.” At one time, Ellen led classes in “French, Latin, German, drawing, elocution, drama, and music.” In 1860, she and her husband of three years, Dr. William Ferguson of London, emigrated to the U.S. The couple first ran a newspaper in Eaton, Ohio, but by the early 1870s they had settled in the Twin Cities. Ellen Ferguson first earned a name for herself locally as a lecturer to all-female audiences on women’s health, physiology and similarly “delicate” subjects (delicate, that is, to Victorian sensibilities.) Ferguson and her lectures attracted the attention and interest of the community’s better-educated, upper-middle class sisterhood, represented by Bloomington’s social lionesses Gertrude Lewis Fifer and Mary Enos Gridley. It was those two women and nine others who signed an open letter to The Pantagraph in the summer of 1871 commending Ferguson’s work and encouraging others to sign-up for her health talks. “We do feel that woman’s needs, her wants—her whole being cannot be more clearly portrayed than has been in this course and in a manner so clear and delicate that the most fastidious cannot take offence,” read the letter. Clearly, local women were starved for forthright and accurate information on gynecological medicine and related issues. “Dr.” Ferguson (her name often appeared accompanied with that professional title) was more than a popular lecturer on women’s health. She was also one of Bloomington-Normal’s more active suffragists. She played, for instance, a leading role in the Illinois Women’s Suffrage Association’s third annual meeting, held Feb. 13-14, 1872, at Herman Schroeder's Opera House in downtown Bloomington. Other speakers included Mary Adelle Hazlett of Michigan and the celebrated Susan B. Anthony of New York. On the second day of the statewide meeting, Ferguson followed Anthony’s half hour opening speech. “She inveighed against the practice of taxation without representation,” noted The Pantagraph of Ferguson “She thought no woman should pay any more tax until she was granted a vote.” Ferguson, however, “spoke principally concerning the frivolity of fashionable life to which so many girls are brought up,” added The Pantagraph. “They are educated too much in the direction of finery and feathers and not enough in the direction of useful information and the knowledge of how to take care of themselves.” Clearly, Ferguson was an unabashed feminist unafraid to challenge the patriarchal constrictions of American society—many of which, let it be said, remain stubbornly in place 146 years after this Bloomington suffrage meeting! Sometime in 1873, if not earlier, Ferguson established a medical institute on the 500 block of East Jefferson Street “for the treatment of chronic diseases of women and children” (see accompanying advertisement.) This “medical and hygienic institute” embraced all sorts of new-fangled medical apparatus then in vogue, such as “electricity, medicated baths … and all other modern medical appliances used both in Europe and America.” Two years later, in 1875, Ferguson led—“piloted,” it was said—a party of local women on a Grand Tour of Europe. Their stops included France, Germany, Italy and Switzerland. Upon her return to Bloomington, Ferguson learned that her husband William was readying their move to Utah, as he had evidently become enamored with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (popularly known as the Mormon Church.) After arriving in Utah Territory, the Fergusons were baptized as Latter-day Saints in the Mormon settlement of St. George. By all accounts, Ellen Ferguson embraced the Mormon faith, and devoted her early efforts in the territory to music education, becoming the cofounder of the Utah Conservatory of Music. William died in Salt Lake City in 1880. By the following summer, when Ferguson embarked on a lecture tour on behalf of the Church of Latter-day Saints, The Pantagraph found occasion to cruelly ridicule her personal appearance and faith, describing her as “rather slovenly in attire, and unattractive.” Clearly, for some of Ferguson’s former allies, her embrace of Mormonism invited such callous criticism, irrespective of her past or present views on women’s rights. Around this same time, Ferguson relocated to the East Coast to complete her medical education “in certain special departments, such as gynecology, obstetrics, minor surgery, etc.” She then returned to Utah to work toward the establishment Deseret Hospital (now LDS Hospital) in Salt Lake City. In Utah, women’s suffrage was first granted by the territorial legislature in 1870. Generally speaking, Mormon women who lived in Utah (and thus enjoyed the right to vote well before most other American women) backed the goals of the national suffrage movement. Yet national suffrage leaders and activists were torn over the issue of whether to welcome support by these Latter-day Saints and, by extension, be tainted with the faith’s polygamy In the spring of 1886, Ferguson helped lead a “Mormon women’s protest” delegation that traveled to Washington, D.C. for an audience with President Grover Cleveland. These Mormon women were there to oppose the strong-armed tactics of federal officials who were cracking down on polygamy by threatening to undo women’s suffrage in Utah (And indeed, in 1887 Congress revoked the right of women to vote in the territory, though suffrage would be restored in the first state constitution of 1896.) Active in Democratic Party politics, Ferguson served as an alternative delegate representing Utah at the 1896 national convention, where she supported the nomination of populist firebrand and free-silver advocate William Jennings Bryan. As such, she’s sometimes cited as the first female delegate to a major party’s nominating convention. One year later, in 1897, Ferguson severed tied to the LDS Church and sometime afterward moved to New York, accompanied by her two daughters, Ethel and Claire. The restless Ferguson then embraced theosophy, an esoteric religious movement characterized for its “mystical and occultist” underpinnings. Ferguson passed away on March 15, 1920, at her residence in Beechhurst, Queens, New York. Her obituary in The Brooklyn Eagle newspaper called her a writer, lecturer and musician of distinction, as well as a devoted suffragist who “figured prominently in politics.” Sadly, Ferguson did not live to see a woman’s right to vote enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. On Aug. 26, 1920, five and a half months after her death, U.S. Secretary of State Bainbridge Colby signed into law the Nineteenth Amendment granting women, at long last, the right to suffrage.",

    "content": "Of all the hardships faced by pioneers, the danger of crossing swollen rivers and creeks is one of the more difficult for present-day folk to fully appreciate. Today, paved highways and byways on raised roadbeds, as well as concrete and steel bridges, enable us to speed across the countryside, oblivious to the landscape and the interplay between topography and surface water. That was a luxury wholly unimaginable to the early settler, whose world was often defined by rain, snow, ice and mud. During the pioneer era, before the coming of the railroads and the erection of substantial bridges, crossing a creek or river often meant discomfort and delay. And heavy rains or snowmelt could transform an intermittent stream or peaceful prairie river into a roiling, insensible force of nature, threatening to dispatch unfortunate souls to their “watery graves.” Safely traversing a watercourse often meant using fords, places where crossing was easier, often due to some natural feature such as gently sloping banks or a shallow or calm stretch of water. One of this area’s most important fords was Newcom’s, which crossed the Sangamon River in Champaign County, roughly halfway between Urbana and Cheney’s Grove in western McLean County. The ford, located in a forested tract known as the Sangamon Timber, was named for Ethan Newcom, who settled there with his family in the late 1820s. This ford proved so popular that the Newcoms established a wayside to offer room and board to weary travelers. “Sometimes, in the fall of the year, 25 or 30 teams would stop there at once,” noted Etzard Duis in his 1874 compilation of early settler biographies. During high water, Newcom’s, like most other well-used crossings, ceased to be a ford at all. In the summer of 1827, George Hinshaw, Jr. was 6 years old when his pioneer family migrated to what would become McLean County. During their journey, the rains came so hard and so often that “the whole of the country seemed covered with water.” To cross Newcom’s Ford, the family had to build their own raft, a delay that cost a week’s travel time. During the pre-railroad days of the Eighth Judicial Circuit, Judge David Davis of Bloomington, attorney Abraham Lincoln of Springfield and others forded one creek or river after another on their way to one county seat and court session after another. For example, from the former Woodford County seat of Metamora the troupe would travel by horseback or wagon the 30 miles to Bloomington. Such a journey required crossing a still-existing ford at Panther Creek (see accompanying image), the largest tributary of the Mackinaw. After passing through or staying the night in Bowling Green—a town that, excepting a limestone-lined well, exists only in historic memory—they would cross the Mackinaw River at Wyatt’s Ford. In 1902, local historian A.V. Pierson penned a brief history of fords on the upper Mackinaw River. Included in the overview were Henline and Wiley fords, immediately south of what would become the community of Colfax in Martin Township. Downriver, there were a half-dozen or more fords in Lexington Township alone, including those named Thompson, Rocky and Myers. And there was Adams’ Ford, just south of Pleasant Hill, which was still in “general use” when Pierson wrote his 1902 history. He also recounted the story of Albert Dodd, one of the county’s most promising lawyers, who in June 1844 drowned while attempting to cross a Mackinaw River ford just southwest of Lexington. A Yale-educated New Englander in his mid-twenties, Dodd was part of a small party returning to Bloomington from a political meeting or convention in either Ottawa or Joliet (accounts differ). A wooden bridge had been washed away, leaving the travelers with the choice between a daring crossing or waiting out the high water. “Dodd had not gone 30 feet until his horse was swimming,” noted Pierson, basing his account on that of George Flesher, who was part of the rescue party. “When he reached the main channel either by his horse losing his balance or by the rush of water, Mr. Dodd was swept from his horse and he was drowned.” A rescue party from Lexington was quickly organized and a raft constructed to recover Dodd’s body. Word reached Bloomington, and the next day a more organized recovery effort included a larger raft and grappling hooks fashioned by Lexington blacksmith Charles Tilbury. On the third day, hundreds more residents from Lexington and Bloomington turned out and at long last Dodd’s lifeless body was found, a mere 50 yards from the ford. Contemporary songwriter Laurelyn Dossett penned the tragic ballad “Anna Lee,” recorded by folk rocker Levon Helm in 2007. The song tells the story of a mother forced to ride into town to care for her sister. Though she promises to return to her two children—“as the sparrow returns to her nest”—she never makes it back home. The wind it did rise and the rain it did fall The river, a shadowy wave Anna Lee never heard danger’s dark call And was swept to her watery grave.",

    "content": "In this age of genetically modified crops, once unimaginable corn yields topping 200-plus bushels per acre are now becoming the norm. But it wasn’t so long ago—as late as the mid-20th century—that 100 bushels of corn an acre, half of today’s average yield, was considered a noteworthy achievement. The first 100-bushel-per-acre yield in McLean County, accomplished on the Mecherle farm east of Bloomington, dates to 1931. By the early 1950s, the 100-bushel barrier was still a formidable one for area corn growers. But the ever-greater application of commercial fertilizers—nitrogen, phosphate and potash—would soon usher in an era of explosive growth in corn yields. It was with an eye on boosting yields that Farm Adviser Eugene Mosbacher organized the McLean County 100 Bushel Corn Club in early 1952. The club was not predicated on competition, noted Mosbacher, who served as farm adviser for the McLean County Farm Bureau from 1947 until 1983. “It’s an educational program and not a contest,” he explained. Instead, the club aimed to grab attention and newspaper headlines—100 bushels per acre, wow!—all in order “to increase interest in better corn yields, to learn methods of achieving high production and to keep abreast of the latest findings in good crop management.” In other words, Mosbacher urged local farmers to first test in the field what worked and what didn’t work, and then report back to the club so other corn growers could learn from both their successes and failures. There was no membership fee to join the club, and no expectation that one had to reach or surpass the 100-bushel plateau. Instead, Mosbacher required members to keep detailed records, including field maps, notes on crop history, soil treatment reports “and all details believed to be of help in producing more corn per acre.” Farmers that reached the 100-bushel threshold (averaged over the entire farm, not just the most productive field or plot) then received special recognition at an annual wintertime banquet In the post-World War II era munitions factories were converted to the peacetime manufacture of fertilizers (nitrogen was a key component in high explosives). Emerging agribusiness giants then aggressively marketed the heavy use of commercial fertilizers as the savior of the American farmer. This was part of the rapid postwar industrialization of the Corn Belt that included the full embrace of the machine age and an ever-greater reliance on tractors, corn pickers, combines and the like. Farmers were also turning to “miracle” pesticides such as DDT that proved effective against the corn borer, a pesky nemesis of Central Illinois farmers. Yet DDT proved so destructive to the natural world, especially birds, that the federal government banned its use in the early 1970s. Improved yields were the easiest way farmers could offset steep increases in production costs resulting from the purchase of expensive new farm machinery and commercial inputs ranging from fertilizers to pesticides. To his credit, Mosbacher stressed soil fertility by asking farmers the question, “Are you putting back what you are taking out?” Although he embraced modern commercial and industrial agriculture, he also recognized the storehouse of knowledge carried by several generations of Central Illinois Corn Belt farmers. “The only thing wrong with manure is there isn’t enough of it,” went a typical Mosbacher observation, this one made at a March 1953 meeting of the 100 bushel club. “Slapping on the fertilizer is not enough to assure good yields,” he said at another club gathering two years later. “It must be applied as needed. And there are other details to attend to, such as ‘stand’ [the number and condition of corn plants in the field], soil texture, moisture, insect and weed control, [and] planting time.” Yet the prevailing ethos in the 1950s was to boost yields quickly with commercial fertilizers. The 100 Bushel Corn Club of McLean County held its first banquet on Feb. 4, 1953, with George W. Scarseth, director of the American Farm Research Association, as the guest speaker. The Bloomington Association of Commerce (today the McLean County Chamber of Commerce) cosponsored the event and presented engraved certificates to the top-yielding farmers. In the club’s first year, nine farmers reached the 100-bushel mark, with five others coming close enough to receive special recognition. Interestingly, six of the nine “100-bushel” certificate recipients were tenant farmers, clear evidence that this area has always had a relatively high rate of farm tenancy. Only two club members, both tenant farmers, reached the 100-bushel goal in the second year, 1953, though twelve others came close. Newell Henderson brought in 103½ bushels per acre on a farm near Stanford, while Merle Keuhling reached a 102-bushel average on a farm outside of Arrowsmith (see accompanying photograph). Henderson applied 100 pounds of nitrogen per acre, 300 to 500 pounds of phosphate and 100 to 200 pounds of potash. He also added another 100 pounds of mixed fertilizer at planting time “to give the crop a good start.” Glenn Klinger, operator of the farm at the Illinois Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Children’s School, was one of five corn growers to reach 100 or more bushels per acre in 1954 (the collections of the McLean County Museum of History include Klinger’s 100 Bushel Corn Club certificate). That year, the 63 club members averaged 80 bushels an acre in their combined 6,805 acres, which was well above the county wide average of 59 bushels. The club then eased conditions to earn 100-bushel certificates for the 1955 season. Instead of averaging the yield from all corn acreage on a farm, corn growers could aim to reach the mark on identified 10-, 20-, or 40-acre plots alone. In a way, the 100 Bushel Corn Club was a victim of its own success. By the late 1950s the club had become inactive as high-yield practices among area farmers became near-universal. In 1962, McLean County’s average corn yield per acre topped 100 bushels for the first time. Today, such an achievement seems quaint. In late August of this year, Soy Capital Ag Services predicted the 2016 McLean County corn crop would come in at a record 219 bushels an acre, besting the previous mark of 217 bushels from two years ago. Last year's yield was 199 bushels per acre. Back on March 1, 1955, Dr. M.B. Russell, chief agronomist at the University of Illinois, was the guest speaker before a meeting of Mosbacher’s corn club. “The 100 bushel yields you seek today will someday be commonplace,” he told the 200 or so McLean County farmers in attendance. Eugene Mosbacher knew that day was coming. His experience with the McLean County 100 Bushel Corn Club told him so. But 200 bushels an acre? In the mid-1950s, that seemed unlikely, even to the most forward-thinking agricultural researchers, educators and leaders. Many longtime area residents will remember Mosbacher’s daily farm program on WJBC radio, which aired for 35 years. He passed away in 2002 at the age of 83.",

    "content": "The COVID-19 crisis has taken many things from us—above all, the lives of 125,000 Americans. We have also lost, for a time, many of the simpler pleasures that enrich family, neighborhood and community—everything from potlucks to baseball games, and dance recitals to the corner tavern. Also struggling to make a comeback is that idyllic summertime staple—summer camp, a world unto itself of swimming, sunburn, campfires, homesickness and, let’s not forget, friendships to last a lifetime. Lake Bloomington was built in 1929-1930 by impounding a stretch of Money Creek, northeast of Hudson. The powers that be—with a nudge from civic-minded folk—agreed to set aside significant shoreline acreage for the enjoyment of public-spirited endeavors. From such foresight came the Boy Scouts’ Camp Heffernan (today the Easterseals Timber Pointe Outdoor Center); Camp Peairs, run by the Girls Scouts; and East Bay Camp. It is to the last of these three camps that we turn our attention. Situated on the lake’s eastern shore, East Bay boasts some of the more picturesque and contemplative spots in all McLean County. And what better place to discover the history of this wooded retreat than the McLean County Museum of History, the award-winning, not-for-profit institution occupying the old courthouse in downtown Bloomington. The museum’s library includes about 16,000 books and periodicals, and the archives span 2,000 linear feet of family papers, church records, diaries, pre-Civil War newspapers, scrapbooks, business ledgers, maps, and a whole lot more. Not surprisingly, in these collections one will find a range of items—including brochures and fliers, bulletins, a newsletter or two, many photographs, and even a one-of-a kind scrapbook compiled in 1934—that reach back in time to the origins and early years of East Bay Camp. Research will show that although long associated with various Protestant denominations—Methodist, Baptist, Evangelical Reformed, Lutheran, Presbyterian, United Brethren, and others—East Bay has always welcomed, and sometimes partnered with, groups such as 4-H and Kiwanis. The story of East Bay is inextricably tied to the story of the Rev. Frank L. Breen, who shepherded the camp through its establishment and rocky start. He then worked tirelessly to make it one of the premier youth and adult church camps in the Prairie State, remaining an invaluable force in its continued success until his death in 1967. As a young man in his thirties, Breen came to Bloomington in 1920 to first serve as minister of the Congregational Church, and later Second Presbyterian (a move necessitated when the latter absorbed the former.) He lived a life not cloistered among his congregants, but rather one dedicated to making his adopted hometown a better place to live. As such, he played an instrumental role getting the Western Avenue Community Center up and running in 1926, and then served as its full-time director from 1931 to 1956. His first wife, Flora J. Giles, died in 1927, and eighteen years later he married Thelma Van Ness, the head librarian at Withers, Bloomington’s long-gone public library. A graduate of Illinois Wesleyan and the University of Illinois Library School, Breen led Withers from 1941 until retirement in 1972. The history museum’s archives include the Frank Breen Collection, consisting mostly of personal and business papers. In addition to East Bay materials, this collection also contains correspondence involving Breen’s relief work during the Great Depression, and his efforts to promote new housing for World War II veterans. One of the more informative East Bay items held by the museum is “A Walk with Mr. Breen,” a 12-page booklet published in 1963, in which Pantagraph reporter Tom Gumbrell strolls the camp grounds with the still-spry good reverenced, who by then was in his late 70s. In this booklet, Breen recounts a 1929 meeting with Lester Martin, an attorney for a group of investors set to construct Lake Bloomington, a long-overdue project for a city then lacking a safe and reliable water supply. The two men drove out to the site of the future lake, and when the roads came to an end near Money Creek, they walked down into a steep hollow—which, once impounded, would be well underwater. It was there they talked about the lake and the dream of a summer camp. Martin promised a leasehold if Breen could promise a viable camp. “So we shook hands on it both of us accepting that as a retainer I suppose—right down there in the bottom of East Bay,” Breen recounted. “And that was the beginning.” Call is the handshake at the bottom of the bay! By 1934—four years after the lake’s completion—the camp’s 40 or so original acres featured a half-mile-long shoreline and an “extensive hinterland of marsh, woods and prairie.” There were sleeping cabins, floored tents, a dining lodge, trading post, outdoor theater, boat docks and swimming beaches. Interestingly, the camp was also once home to the Nellie E. Parham Library, a branch of Withers that catered to campers and local residents. Ninety years after its establishment, East Bay Camp’s mission remains substantially the same—to be a welcoming retreat “set aside for children and adults alike to experience the wonder of God’s creation.” Sadly, the ongoing pandemic has led to the cancellation of the 2020 camp season. Born in the depths of the Great Depression, East Bay has survived earlier national traumas, so there’s no reason to think it won’t survive this one. Until then, the Rev. Frank Breen will leave us on a hopeful note: “You see things that need to be done, things that should be done,” he said of his beloved East Bay Camp. “And if they should be done, they can be done.” Amen to that, Rev. Breen.",

    "content": "Today marks the 38th anniversary of the death of Dr. Clifford E. Horton, one of the titans of Illinois State University athletics. Today, “Pop” Horton is best known as the namesake of the school’s venerable field house and as the founder of the school’s famed Gamma Phi Circus. In fact, this year marks the 90th anniversary of Gamma Phi at ISU, one of the unique and wonderful things that make Bloomington-Normal a special place to call home. Although Gamma Phi wrapped up its annual spring circus at Redbird Arena Saturday evening, many of its performers will be on the Normal Theater stage next Saturday, April 20, as part of a daylong, community-wide celebration to mark World Circus Day (more on those events at the end of this column.) Born in Washington state in 1892, Clifford Horton earned a degree in physical education from the International Young Men’s Christian Association College in Springfield, Mass. (today known as Springfield College). The school was a hotbed for the study and promotion of sports and recreation. Most famously, it was there that James Naismith invented the game of basketball. Horton embraced the “Springfield philosophy” of physical fitness as a means to improve not only one’s body, but the mind and spirit as well. In earlier jobs at YMCAs in Spokane, Wash., and Michigan City, Ind., Horton developed a love of gymnastics and tumbling, and so in Springfield he naturally gravitated toward such programs, including the annual showcase known as the “Home Show.” While still completing college in Massachusetts he taught for a while at Ohio Wesleyan University, joining that school’s chapter of Gamma Phi, a gymnastic and athletic fraternity. In 1923, after earning a master’s degree from Clark University in Worchester, Mass., Horton came to Illinois State Normal (as it was known then) as an athletic coach and men’s PE teacher. He would go on to serve as the head of the physical education department from 1938 until his retirement in 1961. Six years after arriving in Normal, in late 1929, Horton organized the Normal chapter of Gamma Phi. “Our object in bringing this fraternity to life,” chapter president Forrest Steelsmith said in Nov. 1930, “was to promote the interest of physical education among the students and to honor the gymnastic excellence of the individual members of the student body and faculty.” In many ways, Horton and Bloomington-Normal were a perfect fit, given the strong link between gymnastics, tumbling and the like with that of the vibrant world of circus entertainment. From the 1870s into the 1950s, the community was fertile ground for circus performers, primarily trapeze artists. Beginning with Fred and Howard Green, who first performed as the “La Van Brothers,” Bloomington became a wintering ground and training center for dozens of top-flight aerial acts, including the Concellos, Fishers, LeMars, Valentines, and Wards. In fact, it’s said that a stretch of Colton Avenue was known as “Trapeze Terrace” because so many aerialists lived there in the offseason. Not surprisingly, Horton looked to the community’s retired professionals to support his collegiate amateurs. “They were old circus people and it was in their blood,” he once said. “Everybody wants to teach you his act.” Soon after its founding, the Gamma Phi began earning notice with its gymnastics and tumbling exhibitions in and around Bloomington-Normal. On Jan. 22, 1930, to cite a representative example, Horton and his “fraternity men” traveled to the tiny McLean County community of Cooksville to entertain the Parent Teacher Association. One month later, on Feb. 21, they were in Saybrook, another small McLean County town, to wow the locals with their showmanship flare and daring acrobatic feats, including “stunts on parallel bars.” In these early years, Horton performed alongside his students. The following month, Gamma Phi participated in the three-day community circus held each year at the old downtown Bloomington YMCA, located at the corner of East and Washington streets. “It was at this time that a few of the fellows started calling Horton ‘Pop,’ indicative of their affection and respect for him,” recalled Roy “Tiny” Moore, one of Gamma Phi’s charter members. Moore went on to become dean of the College of Health, Physical Education and Recreation at Mankato State University (now Minnesota State). His professional success, and that of many other Gamma Phi alumni through the year, speaks volumes to the fraternity’s role in shaping young people. Although women were not accepted into Gamma Phi until the 1940-41 season, in its early years the fraternity often worked closely with female students in the physical education department by holding “mixed” workshops. Gamma Phi first staged its own circus on the Normal campus in the spring of 1932, and with the exception of the war years 1942 through 1946, it’s been held annually ever since. By the time of Gamma Phi’s 50th anniversary in 1979, performers, in addition to spring’s big “show weekend,” were appearing in 20 to 30 school assemblies, charitable shows, workshops and other exhibitions annually. And there was often a “road show” each year involving the entire troupe. In 1979, for example, they performed at Wharton Field House in Moline, Ill. Ninety years after its founding, Gamma Phi remains a vital presence on the ISU campus and wider community. As mentioned, next Saturday, April 20, is World Circus Day. Festivities kick off with the 9:30 a.m. rededication and blessing of the Ward family plot at Park Hill Cemetery on Bloomington’s west side. The Wards, led by the brother-sister duo Eddie and Jennie, were one of the Twin City’s more influential “flying” teams. At 1 p.m., the McLean County Museum of History hosts a program on the community’s history as the “capital of the aerial kingdom,” ending with the unveiling of the design of a trapeze statue planned for the site of the old YMCA. World Circus Day ends that evening at the Normal Theater and Marriott Hotel and Conference Center with displays of local circus memorabilia (including objects from ISU Milner Library’s world-class Circus and Allied Arts Collection), a performance by the Gamma Phi Circus, and a showing of the 1952 silver screen classic “The Greatest Show on Earth.” For additional information, go to www.mchistory.org . Clifford “Pop” Horton passed away on Apr. 14, 1981 at the age of 88. It’s fitting that before show weekend each spring, Gamma Phi performers make a pilgrimage out to East Lawn Memorial Gardens Cemetery in Bloomington for a graveside visit to their patriarch, “Pop” Horton. And despite what Gamma Phi newcomers are often told by veteran performers, Horton is not buried in the handstand position!",

    "content": "Illinois became the nation’s 21st state in 1818, meaning next year will be the Prairie State’s bicentennial. Remarkably, in nearly 200 years of statehood there has been but one total solar eclipse visible from the Land of Lincoln—though, of course, that number will increase twofold come Monday! The first such eclipse over the State of Illinois occurred on Aug. 7, 1869, a full 148 years ago. And unlike this Monday, when a partial eclipse will be visible above The Pantagraph readership area, in 1869, Bloomington and a large swath of the state were treated to one of the grandest exhibitions the heavens have to offer—a total solar eclipse. “Festoons of glowing wreaths hung around and within the margin, which resembled in no slight degree shreds of red-hot glass, mellowed by distance,” was how Edward R. Roe, watching from downtown Bloomington, described the moment when the moon completely obscured the sun to reveal the sun’s corona. “But with all this rippling glimmer there was no suggestion of heat. It was cold, brilliant and grand.” A full eclipse occurs when a new moon passes between the Earth and Sun and casts its shadow upon the Earth. Where this shadow falls depends on a series of variables involving the intricate gravitational ballet between the earth and the moon (the moon’s orbit, for instance, tilts five degrees more than Earth, so its shadow often falls into open space above or below Earth). Suffice to say, total solar eclipses are rare, as suggested by Illinois’ 148-year drought. Because the Earth and moon are in motion, the moon’s shadow traces a line or arc across the surface of the Earth. A total eclipse is visible within this shadow belt, though “totality” (the period when the moon completely obscures the sun) lasts but a few minutes. For the 1869 eclipse, the path of totality (or “belt of obscuration” in 19th century parlance) moved across Alaska and western Canada, entering the continental United States in the Montana Territory. From there, arcing southeast, it passed through the Dakota Territory and the states of Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and North Carolina. A partial eclipse was visible throughout North America. The band of totality in Illinois was some 195 miles in length, north to south, reaching as far north as the Illinois River community of Lacon, the seat of Marshall County, and as far south as Pinckneyville , the seat of Perry County. In Illinois, the centerline of the path of totality ran from Macomb to Springfield and then Shelbyville. Several months before the event, Prof. W.W. Austin of the Smithsonian Institution and a team of assistants arrived in Springfield to locate the exact line of totality, with the goal to establish a scientific post to observe and collect data on the eclipse. Austin fixed the line some 150 west of the dome of the still under-construction Illinois State Capitol. A square shaft of marble inscribed with the longitude and latitude coordinates was later sunk to mark this location. Bloomington was a little more than 60 miles north of the centerline, though still within the path of totality. The eclipse began at 5:03 p.m. in Bloomington, concluding at 7:02 p.m., almost one hour before sunset. Totality commenced about 6:04 and lasted two minutes, five seconds (these figures are courtesy of the all-knowing Carl Wenning, secretary of the Twin City Amateur Astronomers, and Illinois State University Planetarium director from 1978 to 2000). In 1869, Pantagraph editor Edward R. Roe, a former professor of natural sciences at Illinois State Normal University, published his careful observations of the total eclipse two days after the event. The scientifically minded Roe’s aim was to “put on record” a detailed description of the eclipse as it appeared in Bloomington. He watched the event unfold through a piece of smoked glass from a vantage point somewhere downtown, likely from a roof. “At four o’clock and ten minutes p.m., by a watch set to Chicago time, the eye detected the first contact of the moon’s southeastern margin with the northwestern edge of the sun’s disk,” recorded Roe. “For the first half hour there was nothing remarkable. Then a deficiency of light began to be manifest, and some tendency to a gloominess. Prairies and groves in the distance were still distinct, but there was no glow upon them. Ten minutes later there was a lurid moonlight look to the sky, which rapidly increased, up to the moment of totality.” The deepening gloom perplexed the animal kingdom. “Pigeons whirled in aimless circles through the air and settled on the housetops in rows, with wing and plumage drooping,” described Roe. “At ten minutes to five o’clock, chickens began to go to roost; and at five o’clock lightning bugs left their retreats beneath the bushes, and began to emit their tiny lights.” But what was happening within the immediate environs of downtown Bloomington was of fleeting interest compared to the spectacle far, far above. “As the moon was about to pass fully over the face of the sun, the unobscured portion appeared to flash and scintillate, like molten iron, but with a color like that of gold,” observed Roe. “And at five o’clock and twelve minutes a spontaneous shout went up on all sides, announcing that the eclipse was total.” The difference in the times cited by Roe compared to those by Carl Wenning, even accounting for the hour difference, is likely explained by the imprecise nature of 19th century timekeeping, especially involving amateurs recording astronomical events. “One minute and 56 seconds after the eclipse had become total, the sun flashed out on the northwestern margin, with a grand explosion of light, wholly indescribable,” continued Roe. “Another shout went up from the people who filled the streets; and the grandest exhibition of heavenly phenomena ever witnessed passed its acme.” A correspondent for the Cairo (Ill.) Bulletin traveled to Effingham to view the totality. “A large number of persons had arrived per rail, and many strangers were in town from the country,” noted the reporter. “One old gentleman, over 70 years of age, and one of the earliest pioneers of Illinois, insisted that there would be no eclipse, because he said it was impossible for any person to foretell such things” Language proved inadequate to the task of adequately describing the beauty and power of the total eclipse. “The minutest report will utterly fail to impress the minds of those who did not actually witness the total obscuration, with a realizing sense of the awful sublimity of such as occurrence,” noted the Effingham correspondent.” A transcendent scene unfolded in Quincy, Ill. during the height of the eclipse. A funeral procession found itself on Main Street, nearing Sixth, at the moment of totality. “As the light faded, the solemn procession halted in the street, and while yet the city was enveloped in partial darkness, a prayer was offered up,” read an account in the Quincy Whig newspaper. “As the light burst upon us from the sun the procession moved slowly on, while those composing it began singing a funeral chant. The scene will not soon be forgotten.”",

    "content": "In the spring of 2018, Canadian agricultural equipment manufacturer Brandt Industries began assembling grain augers and belt conveyors at its new facility along Interstate 39 north of Normal. With the likelihood of expansion and more jobs to come, the company remains one of the brighter spots in the regional economy. In many ways, Brandt Industries is a natural fit for Central Illinois. After all, it makes sense to manufacture grain-conveying equipment in what many consider the “buckle” of the “Great American Corn Belt.” And so it’s not surprising to learn that the Twin Cities was once home to another well-known manufacturer of such equipment, though this one, from its very beginnings, was much more of a local story. Organized in Bloomington around the turn of the last century by G. Burt Read, Portable Elevator Manufacturing Co. became well known for its “Little Giant” line of “portable” (or wheeled) grain elevators. “With the proximity of its main office and plant facilities to one of the world’s leading agricultural regions,” noted a local business publication from the mid-1960s, “the firm has gained an intimate knowledge of the equipment needs of the American farmer.” As such, it enjoyed commercial success—both regionally and nationally—for much of the 20th century. Back in the early 1900s, portable elevators such as the ones being made in Bloomington became increasingly important to farmers as they began storing and drying ear corn in ever-larger ventilated farm buildings known as “cribs.” Elevators—using chain-driven buckets or other means—moved ear corn, oats and other grain from wagon to crib without the backbreaking use of scoop shovels. Portable Elevator’s factory was situated along the 900 block of East Grove Street, between the Illinois Central Railroad (now Constitution Trail) and McClun Street. An original three-story brick factory building and several later additions made for a 130,000 square foot complex. The north half of Portable Elevator’s block (the side fronting East Washington Street) featured another sizable industrial concern—American Foundry & Furnace Co. Today, this is the site of the aptly named Foundry development, which includes Green Top Grocery. Manufacturing portable grain elevator equipment demanded precision sheet metal fabrication using press molds, punch presses and other machines. Bloomington was home to plenty of skilled machinists, what with longtime employers such as the Chicago & Alton Railroad Shops and Eureka-Williams Corp. Indeed, it’s a testament to Portable Elevator that it was able to design and manufacture quality grain elevators and other items independent of the giants in the farm machinery business, such as Case, Deere and International Harvester. Recognized as an industry innovator, the Bloomington company made the early leap from wood to steel elevators, and eventually branched out to make Pelco-brand beverage coolers and home freezers, as well as Ideal Dispenser Co. vending machines. Under the steady hand of W.A. Matheson, Sr., Portable Elevator became, by the early 1960s, the largest independent manufacturer of grain elevators in North American. At this time, the local workforce numbered around 100 and sales reached $2 million annually (or more than $17 million in today’s dollars, adjusted for inflation.) It was under Matheson’s watch that Portable acquired Glencoe, a Minn.-based manufacturer of cultivators and other equipment. Glencoe’s chisel plows were popular in the 1960s as farmers sought to reduce wind and water erosion from exposed soil. Big changes came in 1967 when Matheson sold Portable Elevator to Dynamics Corp. for 300,000 stock shares worth some $5.5 million. Matheson’s son, W.A. “Bill” Matheson, Jr., then assumed the company’s reins upon his father’s retirement. By the time the younger Matheson retired in 1984, the metastasizing farm crisis of that decade had dealt a knockout blow to many small- and medium-size equipment manufacturers struggling mightily to maintain market share. Portable Elevator faced the same daunting challenges. In 1985, one year after the younger Matheson’s retirement, the company suspended the manufacturing of grain elevators granaries, farm gates, tillage tools and other products at its Bloomington plant. The final blow came in early Jan. 1987, when Dynamics Corp. sold off its Portable Elevator division to Farmhand Inc. of Excelsior, Minn. The purchase price was an undisclosed amount of Farmhand stock. With the closing came the loss of the remaining 18 local jobs in administration and warehousing. The sale also marked the end of Portable Elevator’s operations in Glencoe, Minn., as Farmhand transferred the manufacture of Glencoe tillage equipment to its main facility in Grinnell, Ia. “We’re not the first farm equipment company to consolidate,” Henry V. Kensing, vice president and general counsel of Dynamics Corp., said at the time. “Consolidations are necessary because there are too many suppliers, and farmers can’t afford to make major purchases.” One year later, on Jan. 20, 1988, Continental Plants Corp. auctioned off what it could of Portable Elevator’s extensive inventory of property, including various presses, fabricating and shop equipment and office furniture. By that fall, Bob Thayer, a product liability specialist working out of an office on East Oakland Avenue, was the sole local employee of the Bloomington’s manufacturer’s successor. Beer Nuts then purchased the Portable Elevator and adjacent American Foundry & Furnace Co. sites. Before it razed the foundry complex, there were plans to salvage some of the building material for the construction of New Life Tabernacle Church on Six Points Road in Bloomington. In the end, the Portable Elevator complex suffered a fiery fate common to many old industrial buildings. In the late evening of Sat., Apr. 1, 1989, Bloomington firefighters were called to the scene when someone noticed a glow from second story windows and smoke billowing from the roof. Firefighters fought to contain the fire as high winds tossed debris onto the AB Hatchery and Garden Center. Bloomington Mayor Jesse Smart appealed to city residents to conserve water because so much was needed to keep the fire and simmering hotspots under control.",

    "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the cancellation of countless holiday gatherings, school pageants, office parties, concerts, dinner dates, travel plans, worship services and just about everything else that makes this time of year so special. Charles Dickens’ Ghost of Christmas Present is having a tough time of it here in 2020, that’s for sure. So perhaps it would do us some good to accompany a spectral sibling, the Ghost of Christmas Past, to an era before social distancing, stay-at-home orders, “masking up,” and other such matters of life and death. Indeed, what better way transport oneself back in time—figuratively speaking, of course—than through photographs? And when it comes to local holiday events and traditions dating to the 1930s and 1940s, we’re in luck. Why? Because the not-for-profit McLean County Museum of History has overseen the digitization of nearly 80,000 Pantagraph photo negatives from those two tumultuous “Greatest Generation” decades. And from those 80,000 images there are many hundreds highlighting the holiday season, most of which are sure to boost one’s waning spirits. Even better, these digitized Pantagraph Negative Collection photos can be freely accessed and searched by the public at large through the Secretary of State’s Illinois Digital Archives (IDA) website—www.idaillinois.org. What will one find on the IDA site when it comes to Pantagraph holiday photos? Well, there are those that vividly capture downtown Bloomington’s retail golden age when there were five department stores within one block of the courthouse (now museum) square. There are also photographs featuring the City of Bloomington’s once-annual Christmas Jubilee program for schoolchildren, and the long-running local adaptation of “A Christmas Carol” staged at the Consistory (now the Bloomington Center for Performing Arts). Other subjects include decorations, dances, Christmas trees, presents; Santa, churchgoers and charitable activities, such as food baskets for needy families. From 1927 to the late 1930s, one of the warmer local holiday traditions was the annual “Community Christmas Carol Sing.” This event entailed hundreds—and on several occasions more than a thousand—local residents gathering at the courthouse steps to sing hymns, carols and secular holiday songs befitting the season. The Pantagraph Negative Collection on the IDA site includes a number of images from this event (see accompanying photograph for a representative example.) The easiest way to search for these Pantagraph images is through the McLean County Museum of History’s own website—www.mchistory.org. Once there, go to the “Research” tab and click on “Resources.” From there, click on “Pantagraph Negative Collection.” That’s all there is to it. That will take you to straight to the Pantagraph negatives, which are divided into three collections by date range: 1930-39; 1940-45; and 1946-1949. More than a decade ago, The Pantagraph donated its vast collection of photo negatives to the McLean County Museum of History, knowing the nationally accredited institution was better equipped to ensure the long-term preservation of these historically priceless images. The negatives span the early 1930s to the year 2000, when the newspaper switched from analog film to digital photography. As a not-for-profit institution, the museum has relied on state and federal grants to digitize the earliest years of the collection. Additional grants and financial support will enable us to digitize and make available online even more Pantagraph negatives. The first Community Christmas Carol Sing was held on Christmas Eve 1927, with some 2,000 folks gathered on the east side of the square. Scenes depicting the Nativity were projected onto a temporary screen. The words of the hymns and carols were likewise projected—in sing-along fashion—onto this board. The third annual “Sing,” held Christmas Eve 1929, began with the “Triple Bass Quartet” playing from the courthouse roof! On Dec. 23, 1930, the day before the fourth annual community sing, members of The Pantagraph’s “Christmas Carol Chorus” boarded flatbed trucks to motor through the Twin Cities, caroling along the way to bring holiday cheer to those unable to join them for the next day’s big event. Six years later, Dec. 23, 1936, the tenth annual “Sing” drew an estimated 1,500 area residents (including 400 seventh and eighth graders) to the west side of the courthouse. The event began with a performance by the George Marton-directed Bloomington Municipal Band in the Courthouse rotunda, with the music piped to outside amplifiers so downtown shoppers could enjoy the music. The array of performers included the saxophone quartet of Raymond Uhrie, Carl Meyers, Harold Powell and Jack Higgins. For the 12th annual event, Dec. 23, 1938, the “first slush of winter underfoot” made for a smaller-than-expected turnout, though those in attendance did not lack for Christmas cheer. The program included “Jingle Bells,” “O Little Town of Bethlehem,” “Silent Night” and “It came Upon the Midnight Clear.” The evening ended with “O Come All Ye Faithful.” “The Community Christmas Carol Sing is open to everyone in this and the surrounding communities,” declared The Pantagraph prior to the 1937 event. “Everybody is invited to join the holiday crowds, to pause a moment in their shopping or business, to forget what may seem to be a care or a burden and join in the singing of the songs which have come down through the ages as best expressing the joy of the Nativity.” Who’s for bringing this tradition back for the 2021 holiday season? Imagine singing “Santa Claus Is Coming to Town” or “Silent Night” with hundreds or more fellow citizens on the museum square in historic downtown Bloomington. How lovely that would be, especially after the trials and tribulations of 2020.",

    "content": "On Dec. 22, 1945, President Harry Truman switched on the twinkling lights of the nation’s Christmas tree. This White House ceremony, now 72 years in the past, held special poignancy for the reason that the tree had remained unlit the previous four holiday seasons, ever since the United States entered the Second World War in December 1941. Victory in Europe (V-E) Day came on May 8, 1945, while Victory over Japan (V-J) Day followed September 2, 1945. “This is the Christmas that a war weary world has prayed for through long and awful years,” President Truman said on the snow covered south lawn of the White House during the tree lighting ceremony. National news stories in the days before Christmas 1945 included the Dec. 21 fatal automobile accident of George Patton, one of the more charismatic and popular American generals of the war. Back in Central Illinois, most everyone was eager and ready to get back to the real business of life—earning a living, paying bills and raising a family. Yet the war could not be so easily forgotten, what with hundreds of local men and more than a few women still serving overseas. Many returned home by way of Operation “Magic Carpet,” an enormous logistical effort to transport some 8 million military personnel from the European and Pacific theaters of war back to the states. Local residents benefitting from the “Magic Carpet” included Sgt. Delmar C. Martens of Bloomington, who arrived in Seattle, Wash., around Dec. 17, aboard the attack transport USS Windsor. It’s not known, though, if Sgt. Martens made it to the family home on West Oakland Avenue in time for Christmas. Some 168,000 Pacific Theater soldiers, sailors and marines were back in the U.S.—many for the first time in several years—though they found themselves stuck at west coast ports due to the rail bottleneck moving discharged veterans eastward. Four months after the war’s end, home front rationing of everything from gasoline to food staples remained a fact of life. Welcome news arrived several days before Christmas with the announcement that those holding sugar rationing stamps would be allotted a five-pound bag at the start of the New Year. With all the holiday cooking and baking, many folks had already used up their current sugar allocation, which threatened to make for a bitter (or “sugarless”) January. “As we go into 1946, housewives will still have to guard the sugar bowl,” declared Ben J. Becker, acting director of the Peoria district’s Office of Price Administration. “And so will industrial users. There is no increase in allotments to the bakers, candymakers and other such users. They have to count their spoonfuls, too.” Tire rationing was set to end with the arrival of the New Year. Even so, the pent-up demand far exceeded supply, which meant local tire dealers would become the default gatekeepers when it came to who would, and who would not, receive new tires. “A lot of people are going to lose their heads and we tire dealers are going to have to sneak down alleys in order to get safely home,” said one local “tire man.” The slow return to normalcy in late 1945 included an uptick in holiday shopping in downtown Bloomington. In fact, department store sales in the city were up 20 percent over the previous year. There were two big local retailers on the north side of the square, W.H. Roland’s and C.W. Klemm’s. Roland’s was the fancier of the two, catering as it did to the city’s wealthier and more fashion-conscious set. The store promised handbags by “top-name” designers, including those by David’s Fifth Avenue running as high as $28.50. There were also genuine alligator bags from $24.50 to $65. To put these prices in perspective, $65 in 1945 would be the equivalent of $880 in inflation-adjusted 2017 dollars. There were dozens and dozens of other retail stores located downtown where area residents could shop for holiday gifts, from stocking stuffers to that extra special something for under the tree. Holder Hardware Co. on North East Street had Swing-a-Way can openers for $1.79, and 1½ quart Pyrex Ware casserole dishes for 65 cents. Biasi’s drug store, located on the square’s east side, advertised Schick electric shavers for $18, and Airflow brand tobacco pipes for $6.50. Woolen Mill Store on North Main Street sold heads scarves from $1.39 to $3.98, and blouses from $3.19 to $4.95. On Dec. 23, the Louis E. Davis American Legion post staged its annual Christmas party for the children of veterans from both world wars. Held at the McBarnes Memorial Building, the afternoon party included an appearance by Santa Claus and several of his elves who distributed candy, nuts and oranges. The entertainment included performances by members of the Russell Brothers Circus wintering in Bloomington, including Bebe Siegrist, a trapeze artist. On Christmas Day, Home Sweet Home Mission served the community’s neediest residents—no matter their “race, creed, or color”—a dinner of roast pig, baked duck, chicken and all the Yuletide fixings. The Pantagraph devoted its Dec. 25 1945 editorial to the deteriorating relationship between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, an indispensible wartime ally already assuming its belligerent Cold War posture. “We have just ended the bloodiest war in history. Already we are talking about the next war,” declared the editorial. “Today, while we shout ‘Peace on earth, good will toward men,’ we hate.” The editors called on Americans to shed their mistrust and fear of those unlike themselves. “We hate the Jews. We hate the Negroes. We hate the [Japanese]. We hate the Germans. We hate the Russians,” the editors wrote. “We often hate because we do not understand. Not understanding, we fear. And being afraid, we hate.” Only with a “sincere effort to understand,” concluded the editorial, will we begin to accept that others—whether our neighbors next door or those living on the opposite side of the globe—have the right, just as we do, “to see things differently.” A hopeful Christmas message for 1945. And for 2017 as well.",

    "content": "“Do Not Fear Influenza,” read a local Red Cross notice from October 1918. “Learn how to avoid it—How to care for those who have it—What to do if you get it.” Also known as the Spanish flu, the influenza pandemic of 1918 claimed an estimated 600,000 American lives, making it the deadliest such outbreak in the nation's history. Bloomington was hit hard as well, and in October 1918, the worst month of the scourge, the city was brought to a near standstill. A look back at the 1918 pandemic is scary stuff for sure. That said, it also can be reassuring to learn that a century ago the nation triumphed over an even deadlier pathogen than today’s COVID-19. And we did so with public health measures and ordinary folk embracing common sense routines—from social distancing to repeated handwashing. Before victory, though, there were staggering losses. As the bodies began piling up from the pandemic, the World War in Europe ground to a bloody end. The cruelly named “war to end all wars” led to the deaths of some 20 million soldiers and civilians. In its wake, the influenza pandemic spread to nearly every corner of the globe, taking in the process another 50 million or more souls. It was, quite simply, a brutal one-two punch to a benumbed world. “The influenza epidemic, which is sweeping the country, has invaded every township of McLean County,” reported The Pantagraph on Oct. 12, 1918. “Already there are thousands of cases of the disease in this community and a number of deaths have resulted.” It’s believed that the first Bloomington resident to die of the Spanish flu was 27-year-old factory worker Fred Meyers, who died on Sept. 29. That same day, James Carroll, a 26-year-old soldier from the eastern McLean County community of Arrowsmith, died while stationed at Camp Grant in Rockford. As with many influenza victims, Carroll appeared on the mend before quite rapidly and unexpectedly dying of complications from pneumonia. This was a flu \"unlike any other\" because it targeted those in their 20s and 30s, generally the healthiest segment of the population. By early October, the pages of The Pantagraph and its competitor, the long-gone Daily Bulletin, were crowded with obituaries, with many residents dying while stationed at World War I training camps. On Oct. 2, The Bulletin reported the death of Bloomington resident Ransom Johnson at Camp Devens in Massachusetts, and Harry Pietsch, also of Bloomington, at Camp Grant. The situation at the latter was such that on Oct. 7, Col. Charles B. Hagadorn, the acting commander, took his own life, as he was apparently unable to cope with the more than 500 influenza deaths, camp-wide, on his watch. By Oct. 11, Bloomington schools—both public and private—were ordered closed, as well as theaters and churches. Normal quickly followed suit, while Judge James Riley suspended county court business. “Influenza is a crowd disease and it can be most effectively combated by comparative isolation,” declared The Pantagraph a day later. “The diseases must be met and fought fearlessly. Panic would only contribute to its spread. Let everyone look to his personal health as never before and take every precaution possible against contracting the influenza.” The newspaper even called for a temporary halt to public funerals. “Protect others by sneezing or coughing into handkerchiefs or cloths, which should be boiled or burned,” instructed the local Red Cross influenza committee. Area residents in proximity to those sickened were advised to wear gauze masks—“which may be obtained from the Red Cross or may be made at home of four or six folds of gauze.” This committee also organized the donation of supplies, ranging from single iron beds to jams and jellies (it was said that those recovering were keen for sweets). Area doctors were “literally working day and night,” a situation complicated by the dire shortage of trained nurses. Undertakers too were “working almost to the limit,” circumstances exacerbated by the fact that several area gravediggers were sent to Rockford to help bury the hundreds of dead at Camp Grant. Local public health officials established an influenza command center at old Withers Library in downtown Bloomington, and they accepted an offer by the directors of the Bloomington Country Club to use their clubhouse as a temporary hospital. Clara Brian, McLean County’s first Home Bureau adviser, recalled the “never-to-be-forgotten flu epidemic” in a later reminiscence. “I began work as dietitian of the emergency hospital set up in the Bloomington Country Club,” she wrote. “During the two weeks, 3,600 meals were prepared and served. One hundred and fourteen patients were cared for by doctors and nursing staff.” At the country club, Brian and others undoubtedly helped save many lives, but the virus sometimes overwhelmed their best intentions and efforts. Those who died at the converted country club included 15-year-old Marie Jasper of Bloomington. She was the only one of nine members of her family admitted to the hospital to succumb to the virus. Julia Scott Vrooman’s home at 701 E. Taylor St. (today known as the Vrooman Mansion) was also used as a hospital, though its beds were reserved for ailing Illinois Wesleyan University students enrolled in a wartime training program. With the epidemic raging in Bloomington, the virus made no distinction between rich and poor. On Oct. 11, Albert H. Hoopes, a leading Bloomington merchant, called a barber to his home for his morning shave. Although he was feeling a little under the weather, his condition did not appear worrisome. Hoopes, though, was dead by that afternoon. \"Grim Reaper is Unusually Busy\" noted an Oct. 13 newspaper headline. Five days later, one local doctor estimated the number of influenza cases in Bloomington at 1,700. There was no more room at the country club or Scott-Vrooman home, so family members had to treat all but the most severe cases from home, hoping for a periodic visit by a fatigued nurse or physician. Yet by month’s end, doctors were reporting a marked decline in the number of new cases, and by the first week of November, local schools, churches, and theaters had reopened, and the two emergency hospitals closed. Influenza returned during the first three months of 1919, but not with the vehemence of the previous fall. The Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 is a sobering lesson regarding the virulence of communicable diseases. But let us also remember it as a story of perseverance and community spirit. We could all use a little hope these days.",

    "content": "As thoughts this month turn to newly elected leaders assuming office, it’s a fitting time to look back at the groundbreaking legacy forged by Florence Fifer Bohrer of Bloomington, the first women to serve in the Illinois State Senate. It was 92 years ago this weekend, Jan. 7, 1925, that Bohrer first took a seat in the Senate chamber at the Illinois State Capitol. As a community leader in the Twin Cities and state legislator in Springfield, she carried herself with grace and dignity, shunned the spotlight and treated political friends and foes alike with respect. She was an ardent believer in small “r” republican virtues and values, and approached public policy with a serious, studious bent. In other words, Florence Fifer Bohrer represented a startling contrast to our present-day confluence of reality TV celebrityhood and mean-spirited, dumbed-down, Twitter-fueled politics. Bohrer was the first women in the Illinois Senate, but not the first state legislator. That honor goes to Lottie Holman O’Neill, a Republican state representative from Downers Grove first elected in 1922. O’Neill’s and then Bohrer’s elections followed passage, in 1920, of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution making women’s suffrage the law of the land. Bohrer was no stranger to politics, as she was 11 years old when her father, Joseph W. “Private Joe” Fifer, was elected Republican governor of Illinois. That was 1888, and for the next four years she lived in the Executive Mansion in Springfield, famously teaching her black pony to walk up the mansion’s front porch steps. Florence Fifer was later educated at a progressive Unitarian boarding school in Wisconsin and eventually married local boy and attorney Jacob Bohrer. As with many whipsmart women at the time who faced economic, social, legal and political barriers of a patriarchal society, Bohrer first directed her energies toward local issues involving education, public health and welfare. Long before she contemplated running for office, for instance, played an instrumental role in the success of the McLean County Anti-Tuberculosis Society and the opening of Fairview Sanitarium. “While woman’s first duty is to care for her own children and her home,” Bohrer once said, “intelligent woman accepted long since the fact that to be a good mother and homemaker, she must push out the walls of her home to include the community.” On Jan. 24, 1924, her 47th birthday, a group of local women stunned Bohrer with the proposition that she run for public office. Although “the whole idea seemed preposterous,” Bohrer recalled in her memoirs, she eventually came around, especially when faced with unanimous declarations of support from the many women’s organizations, clubs and societies in McLean County. She defeated the Republican incumbent in the primary and her Democratic challenger in the general election, along the way receiving key support from the Florence Fifer Bohrer Club, an energetic group of Republican and Democratic women. On the morning of Jan. 7, 1925, some 60 of these women traveled to Springfield aboard a special train chartered by the Illinois Republican Women’s Club, joining likeminded supporters from Chicago and Joliet. Similar contingents of politically active women arrived in the state capital from Decatur, Peoria and elsewhere. After two years as the only woman in the Illinois General Assembly, Lottie Holman O’Neill was now joined by not only Bohrer, but two newly elected state representatives, Rena Elrod and Katherine Hancock Goode, both of Chicago. At the time, there were 204 members of the General Assembly (153 representatives and 51 senators), meaning women comprised less than 2 percent of the seats in the state legislature. On that historic afternoon, Bohrer took her seat to much applause from the Senate floor and gallery. “Not only was Sen. Bohrer the center of interest for the Bloomington delegation,” noted The Pantagraph, “but she was the center of attraction for innumerable reporters, who hovered about her all during the session, and the remainder of the day, and of the photographer after photographer who vied for the best view of the smiling figure in blue.” After all the excitement at the State Capitol, the Illinois Republican Women’s Club honored the four female legislators with an evening banquet at the Leland Hotel in downtown Springfield. “Women have not come into politics to represent a new interest in the political field, but rather to add their voices to the groups which already exist in our social and economic life,” Bohrer said that night. “And so we take our places in the legislature not as women but as citizens of our great commonwealth, citizens chosen by the men and women of our districts to represent all interests in a fair and impartial manner.” Reelected in 1928, Bohrer had a productive eight-year tenure in the Senate, earning a reputation as an advocate for state charitable institutions and helping to overhaul child welfare laws. During her first term, Bohrer had the pleasure to introduce the bill making “Illinois” the official state song. Today, the Prairie State may be sagging under the weight of seemingly intractable problems relating to finances and poor governance, but at least it can claim one of the more beautiful and moving state songs in the nation (seriously, give it a listen on YouTube!) Florence Fifer Bohrer had plenty of legislative disappointments as well. She once introduced a bill requiring fathers, upon proof of paternity, to support children born out of wedlock. “But, this is still a man’s world, and a man’s legislature,” she told a gathering of the Illinois State Bar Association in 1931. “After a faithful canvass of the situation I could find no vote but my own in favor of this measure, and it was promptly withdrawn.” She ran for a third term, but was buried in the Democratic landslide of 1932. In 2016, 16 of 59 state senators and 42 of 118 state representatives in Illinois were women. Although that made the Land of Lincoln sixth highest among all states in the percentage of women in state legislatures (32.8 percent), there’s still a ways to go before approaching anything resembling gender parity. The Fifer family home still stands on the east side of Bloomington’s Franklin Park, at the corner of McLean and Walnut streets. Look for the two Illinois State Historical Society (ISHS) markers—one for Gov. Fifer and the other for Sen. Bohrer. During the September 2005 dedication of the Florence Fifer Bohrer marker, ISHS Executive Director William Furry paid tribute to the state’s first woman senator by singing a lovely solo rendition of “Illinois.”",

    "content": "American residential architecture has long favored dominant English-inspired styles. When most folks conjure up their ideal of an attractive, marketable home, they’re more often than not thinking along the lines of a gingerbread Queen Anne, a cozy Arts & Crafts, a stately Colonial Revival or other “respectable” styles rooted in the Anglo-American tradition. That said, there was a time in the early 20th century when Spanish Revival architecture—featuring textured or stuccoed walls, low-sloped or flat barrel-tiled roofs, arcaded porches and patios, decorative parapets and other “exotic” elements—had its day in the sun. The popularity of this architectural style was but one manifestation of the “Spanish craze” that swept the U.S. in the 1920s, influencing everything from furniture to literature and fine art to fashion. In architecture, this craze for all things “Spanish” took off when Bertram Goodhue wowed visitors to the 1915-1917 Panama California Exposition in San Diego with his collection of Spanish Revival buildings. Yet “Spanish” Revival is somewhat of a misnomer, as a case can be made that this style originated centuries earlier in Mexico, which at the time encompassed much of California and what’s today the American Southwest. Calling such architecture “Spanish” was a way for Americans to sidestep its Mexican and indigenous origins. After all, Europeans borrowed heavily from indigenous construction methods and styles, as they were want to do. To put it bluntly, Spanish was seen as “white,” making its exoticness safer in the eyes of many American homeowners who would’ve otherwise balked at embracing the cultural heritage of darker complexioned Mexicans and native peoples. To confuse matters even more, Spanish Revival is often used as a general term for a range of closely related architectural styles, including Mission, Pueblo, Monterey and Territorial Revival. Locally, the Spanish craze in homebuilding was given a boost with the May 1926 grand opening of the new seven-story Ensenberger Furniture Store building on the west side of the courthouse square in downtown Bloomington (now the Ensenberger Condominiums). The entire seventh floor showcased a fully furnished six-room “Spanish bungalow” and surrounding “Spanish garden” (see accompanying image). Strange though this elaborate display may seem to us today, Ensenberger’s was simply mimicking similar promotions staged by other furniture and department stores in other cities. In 1923, to cite one example, Wanamaker’s in Manhattan unveiled its own “Spanish house” and line of corresponding furniture and “antiques.” Although there were already Spanish Revival homes popping up in the Twin Cities, Ensenberger’s seventh floor “exhibit” clearly boosted local interest in such architecture. In late December 1927, The Pantagraph noted that a majority of new homes built in Normal the previous twelve months were “either of the Spanish Colonial type or of the modern bungalow design.” The Briarwood neighborhood northeast of the corner of Linden and Emerson streets has a small collection of Spanish Revival homes. One of the more prominent, 38 Norbloom Ave., was completed in 1928 and put on the market that October. In the nine decades that have followed, the exterior of this eye-catching residence has remained relatively unchanged. One of the finest Spanish Revival homes in the Twin Cities can be found at the corner of Mercer Avenue and Taylor Street on the east edge of Bloomington’s Founders’ Grove neighborhood. Completed in the spring of 1927, it first served as the community’s model “Home Beautiful” to promote residential construction and dependent businesses, including local builders, contractors, furniture stores and the like. Constructed of Haydite concrete block (said to be “fire-proof, damp-proof and light in weight”) and clad in Portland cement stucco, this two-story beauty represented a striking departure, architecturally speaking, from its more traditional neighbors. Home builders and mail order catalog giants embraced the middlebrow popularity of Spanish Revival architecture. Sears Roebuck and Co. had a line of such homes, including the “San Jose,” “Del Rey,” and the popular two-story “Alhambra.” Wardway Homes, the Montgomery Ward line of cut-and-fitted kit homes, featured “The Sonora,” a five-room bungalow, as well as the similarly styled “Barcelona.” In addition to residences and apartment buildings, there are a few Spanish Revival commercial buildings in the Twin Cities. In the late 1920s, L.G. Nierstheimer opened his stucco-sided drug store at 1302 N. Main St. Today, this building, which still features distinctive red barrel-tiled trim atop the parapet, is occupied by Reverberation Vinyl record store. There are also unexpected Spanish Revival treasures scattered throughout the Twin Cities, such as the small but lovely home at 1110 Colton Ave. featuring, among other marvelous details, scalloped parapets over the porch and main roof. The harsh Midwest climate posed various challenges and costly problems to Spanish Revival homeowners. Flat roofs, for example, make sense in an arid or semi-arid climate, though much less so in regions with considerable precipitation—be it rain or snow or both. And airy patios were wonderful in the late-summer, but not so much in the dead of winter. This helps explain why many such homes have undergone significant alterations in the nearly century since they were built. Many tiled roofs, it almost goes without saying, have been replaced with asphalt shingles. Likewise, 1920s stucco took a beating in colder climes, and some area buildings are now slathered in more substantial concrete. Most regrettably, though, a few stucco-sided homes in the area have been covered in aluminum or vinyl siding. And not surprisingly, some local Spanish Revival residences have been lost to the wrecking ball, such as a five-room bungalow on the 1300 block of Franklin Avenue near the Illinois Wesleyan University campus. There was the inevitable pushback against Spanish Revival. Architect Howard Major argued that the “Spanish” style “was totally at variance with our Anglo-Saxon temperament” and the “national character.” Of course, as historian Richard L. Kagan has noted in his recent work, The Spanish Craze: America’s Fascination with the Hispanic World, 1779-1939, this style was “less of a foreign import” than Major imagined, given its roots in the American Southwest, California and Florida. By early 1944, for a story on housing in the coming post-World War II years, The Pantagraph detailed the planned conversion of 710 Normal Ave. from a two-story “Spanish” home to one with mid-century modern styling. The plan, drawn up by the local architectural firm of Archie Schaeffer and Philip Hooton, was featured in American Home magazine. This soon-to-be-converted Spanish Revival house, noted The Pantagraph, “is typical of many in Bloomington-Normal which have been outdated by architectural trends.” What was once popular had now fallen out of fashion. Yet in the years afterward, plenty of folks have rallied around this architectural moment to preserve and restore these homes. Space prohibits a complete listing of all such residences still standing in the Twin Cities. But that gives you an excuse to take a walk or drive through some of Bloomington-Normal’s pre-World War II neighborhoods and discover anew our Spanish Revival heritage.",

    "content": "During the summer of 1855, cholera swept through Bloomington and outlying communities. It was one of the largest outbreaks of this dreaded infectious disease in local history. That summer 164 years ago, deaths from cholera in Bloomington totaled more than 30. Given that the city’s population was around 5,000 at the time (Normal was not established until a few years later), the number of dead in 1855 would be the equivalent—proportionally speaking—to the loss of some 1,100 Twin City residents today, given the dramatic increase in population over the ensuing years. Cholera is most often transmitted through water or food contaminated with human waste. Back in 1855, though, the best medical minds believed the “Asiatic terror” (as cholera was sometimes called) emanated from “miasmas,” a fancy word for the fetid, odiferous vapors of garbage, sewage and other types of rotting organic material. “Summer is at hand,” warned The Pantagraph in the latter half of May 1855. “The very hot days will soon be upon us—and so may the cholera, or some other disease—now therefore is the time to clear up the alleys, the stable litter and everything that may offend either the sight or the smell. Let us have a general slicking up. Symptoms of cholera include watery diarrhea, cramps, dehydration, the collapse of the circulatory system and shock. What makes the disease so scary is the rapidity in which it can kill. It’s not unheard for unsuspecting carriers of the cholera bacterium to feel fine and dandy in the morning only to turn up dead by the afternoon. Recalling the 1855 outbreak years later, Dr. Charles R. Parke said it began in the final days of July with the deaths of five or six Germans staying at a boarding house and saloon at the corner of Center and Front streets in downtown Bloomington. “We have heard of five deaths in the city and two in the country, occurring suddenly, and said to have been from cholera, within the last two or three days,” reported the Aug. 1 Pantagraph. That was a harbinger of more death to come. Due to the “many false and unwarrantable reports … respecting the health of our city,” Bloomington Mayor Franklin Price issued a public statement on the outbreak in the Aug. 8, 1855 Pantagraph. Included were two lists which together provided the names or identities of 23 known cholera victims who died within the city limits during the preceding two weeks. Bloomington got off relatively easy, though, compared to the DeWitt County community of Waynesville, which lost 50 or so residents (out of a population of 300 to 350.) At the Ackerson place outside of Waynesville, six family members were felled by the disease— John Ackerman, Sr. and his wife; their children Sarah Ann, Jane and an unnamed infant; and John’s sister, Charlotte Montgomery. Neighbors then burned down the Ackerson house and its contents, hoping the flames would rid the place of that which killed them. On a happier note, two Ackerson children, John, Jr. and Susan, were spared, and both lived long lives and raised good-size families. In 1934, Samantha Richards recounted her experience as a six-year-old living in Waynesville that awful summer (though she misremembered the year as 1854.) There was the time, for example, when Richards and her sister were sent on an evening errand and found a woman lying dead in the street. The Pantagraph relayed how Richards and her mother “would sit at the window and watch neighbors carry the dead to the Evergreen Cemetery [on the village’s eastern end] … six to ten a night.” Although Richards’ telling might contain some unwitting exaggeration, she nonetheless spoke to the raw fear and societal strain manifest in cholera outbreaks. Community leaders often suppressed news relating to the appearance or severity of the disease for fear of depressing trade and commerce or negatively impacting hoped-for population growth. During a suspected outbreak in the spring of 1854, The Pantagraph made it clear it would not be party to such cover-ups. “We are not unaware that it is the custom with many editors to conceal the truth in such diseases, for fear that it might injure the character or the business of their place,” the newspaper declared, “but in such rascality we will not participate. Such concealment would be indictable in a court of moral equity.” In 1930, local historian and genealogist Milo Custer, the first curator of the McLean County Historical Society (now the Museum of History), authored a research paper on 19th century area cholera mortality (see accompanying image.) From 1834 to 1873, Custer identified at least 140 cholera deaths—clustered in 7 distinct outbreaks—in this part of Central Illinois (though the actual number was undoubtedly higher, though how much higher will remain one of those mysteries forever lost to time.) The 1855 outbreak—which lasted from late July through the first three weeks of August—felled more than 70 residents in McLean County and the surrounding counties. Custer recorded deaths in Clarksville, Twin Grove and other rural settlements in McLean County, as well as in or near Congerville, Waynesville and elsewhere outside of McLean County. Due to the lack of vital records (Illinois counties were not required by the state to maintain a death register until 1916), Custer relied on things like newspaper obituaries and cemetery records. Gravestones themselves could also prove helpful. In 1941, William Brigham, superintendant of McLean County schools, said that some of the older cemeteries in the area featured headstones reading, in part, “Died of cholera.” The Lytleville Cemetery north of Heyworth was said to be one such burial ground. In the summer of 1855, Waynesville residents struggled to make sense of the Old Testament-like plague inflicted upon their little village. “A cemetery was started north of the present community high school site, but no stones were put up and all traces of that burial grounds were lost,” remembered Samantha Richards. “Some of the farmers between Waynesville and McLean buried their dead along the rail fences.” “But the disease died out and the dread experience was ended,” concluded The Pantagraph in its 1934 article on Richards and her firsthand account of the 1855 outbreak. “Only occasionally now does one hear a reminder of the sad experience. And it is always with the same feeling expressed by Mrs. Richards—thanks that science has made such progress that it is now unthinkable that any community should have such an experience as those pioneers of Waynesville.” That may be true in the United States and many other nations, but cholera—although it’s treatable with rehydration, intravenous fluids and antibiotics—still plagues much of the developing world. According to the United Nations, there are an estimated 1.3 to 4 million infections and 21,000 to 143,000 cholera deaths annually.",

    "content": "In the fall of 1875, at a shooting tournament in Bloomington, champion marksman Adam H. Bogardus killed 25 of 28 pigeons in 2 minutes and 27 seconds, “the birds being thrown in the air two at a time,” reported The Pantagraph, “and he loading his own gun.” Such was the utter cruelty of trap shooting before the widespread adoption of stand-in targets made of glass or clay. Most Americans barely batted an eye over these bloodbaths, and the most accomplished “men of the trigger” were celebrated athletes and master showman feted across the U.S. and Europe. Perhaps the biggest name in the sport was Central Illinois’ own Adam Bogardus, national and world champion trap shooter. Born in 1834 in Upstate New York, Bogardus married Cordelia Dearstyne and the two settled in the Logan County community of Elkhart, about 45 miles south of Bloomington. He apparently honed his sharpshooting skills hunting passenger pigeons, prairie chickens and other fast-disappearing game birds from the fast-disappearing undrained prairies of Illinois. “In McLean County, Ford County, and the others of the tier on that line, there is as good grouse-shooting as any I have known of anywhere in Illinois,” Bogardus noted in his book “Field, Cover, and Trap Shooting,” published in 1874. “As good places as any to get off the railroad are at Bellflower in McLean County, and Gibson [City] in Ford County.” In 1872, Bogardus paired with New Jersey trap shooter Miles Johnson for an extensive hunting trip in eastern McLean County. “We camped near Bellflower, and had a man for camp-keeper while Miles and I shot,” recalled Bogardus. “We were out ten days, and in that time bagged 600 grouse [prairie chickens], shooting only mornings and evenings.” Today, some 100 to 200 prairie chickens on state-managed land are all that remain in Illinois of this magnificent species that once numbered 10 to 14 million in the Prairie State alone. If the oft-told stories are to be believed, Bogardus entered his first wing shot competition in 1868 in St. Louis. Not long after that, he faced a trap shooter from Detroit in a $200-a-side match in Elkhart. Each man was given the opportunity to kill 50 birds, with Bogardus bringing down 46 and Stanton 40. Wing shot competitions were all the craze by the mid-1870s. The newly organized Bloomington Shooting Club staged a tournament in early Oct. 1875 at the McLean County fairgrounds, then located along West Washington Street on the city’s western edge. The two-day competition required the shipment of some 2,000 pigeons, and involved notable wing shots like Bogardus as well as shooting clubs from Clinton, Decatur, Delavan, Lincoln and elsewhere. In addition to wild (passenger) and domestic pigeons, competitive trap shooters slaughtered untold numbers of quail, meadowlarks and sparrows. The use of live targets in this Bloomington tournament came under local attack. “It is simply amazing that such cruelty and barbarity [are] permitted, much less applauded, in a civilized community,” read an open letter in the Oct. 8, 1875 Pantagraph, signed only “Anti-Cruelty.” “The statues of Illinois make it a penal offense to engage in such cruelty, but there is no prospect of seeing the law enforced,” added the letter-writer. “The only thing to do is to decry and condemn the brutalizing tendency of such entertainments, and endeavor to do better things than to encourage the wanton and useless taking of life.” Later that same month, on Oct. 22, Bogardus was in Decatur for two matches. In the first, he dispatched 39 of 40 birds released from two traps 40 yards apart. In the second, “doing his own loading,” he killed 17 of 18 birds. The outcry over the slaughter of birds—to say nothing of the cost of collecting, feeding and transporting them—spurred the search for cheaper and more humane alternatives. Bloomington hosted another shooting tournament one year after the first, in Oct. 1876, but this time around Bogardus was aiming not for live birds but rather glass targets. “Mr. Bogardus will break 50 small glass balls in 8 minutes and load his own gun,” was the promise of tournament organizers. It was around this time that Bogardus developed a patented trap that could throw glass balls. Such targets were sometimes filled with feathers (so as to mimic the real thing when blasted) and certain types were known as “Bogardus balls.” In the latter half of the 19th century, celebrity trap shooters popularized their sport through circus-like exhibitions of strength and stamina. In Jan. 1877, for example, Bogardus was in New York City, appearing at Patrick’s Gilmore’s Garden, a popular venue for sporting events and the predecessor to Madison Square Garden. There he succeeded in breaking 5,000 glass balls in 500 minutes or less, accomplishing the feat in 480 minutes (8 hours) and 45 seconds. An exhausted Bogardus shattered the final 300 balls while seated in a chair. In late Oct. 1880, Bogardus and four of his sons—Eugene, Edward, Peter and five-year-old Henry—performed at Schroder’s Opera House on the east side of the courthouse square in downtown Bloomington. “Captain Bogardus,” promised The Pantagraph, “will shoot with a rifle nickels from each of the boys’ fingers, and knock the ashes from a cigar held in Eugene’s mouth.” Likewise, his sons shot glass balls and marbles from their father’s hands. “That playing William Tell is not an avocation entirely free from danger is shown by various scars on the captain’s hands where he was shot five different times by his sons, when bullets went a bit over the edge of the coins or balls he was holding in his fingers,” noted a later profile. Bogardus lost his unofficial national title in 1883 when the enigmatic William Frank Carver bested him in a series of competitions. Yet Bogardus continued to capture the public’s imagination by performing with Buffalo Bill Cody’s Wild West show and other such traveling spectacles. Late in his life, Bogardus, who settled into semi-retirement in Lincoln, Ill., was a pitchman for a patent medicine known as Foley’s Kidney Pills. “I was subject to severe backache and pains in my kidneys with suppression and oftentimes cloudy voiding,” he declared in one advertising testimonial. “Now I have taken three bottles of Foley’s Kidney Pills and feel 100 percent better.” Adam Henry Bogardus passed away on Aug. 10, 1913, at the age of 78. He was laid to rest at the cemetery atop Elkhart Hill. It’s one of the lovelier, more peaceful spots in all Central Illinois, making it an interesting juxtaposition with the man who earned a living amid the deafening bang and acrid smoke of an overheated shotgun.",
